"I found out today that my wife is cheating on me. I love her, but she won’t tell the truth even when I have proof. When I beg her to tell the truth, she yells, cusses, and gets a huge attitude.","Hi Prattville, I'm sorry this is happening to you. You need support right now, and yes, you need answers. She is in denial and is trying to hide the truth, to protect herself. This is a natural behaviour. You don't indicate whether she wants the marriage, or is planning to leave. Which way you go from here depends in part on the answer to that question. If she wants the marriage, you certainly have the right to say ""I need answers to all my questions"". Giving you the information she needs has to be (if she wants the marriage) more important than protecting herself. I would support your right to advocate for all the information you need in order to feel secure or make decisions. She may fear that the truth will turn you away. If you want to, you can reassure her that you want the marriage no matter what the truth is. If the marriage is to survive, it needs openness.If, on the other hand, she's planning to end the marriage, then you might want to resign yourself to the fact that you may never get the information you seek. You are better off, in that case, seeking support from friends and family rather than beating on a closed door. Your wife has some decisions to make. Try to give her a bit of time to make them. You can patiently say ""I know this thing is happening. Talk to me so we can deal with it together. I want to move forward but I need the truth."" Only time (and a good therapist, if she is willing and wants the marriage) will tell which way this one will go. Individually, you can seek professional help as well.",The amount of stress you have and the anxiety in your situation are almost guaranteed to be related.
"My coworkers are making false statements about me to the boss, saying I have mood swings. They have no proof to back it up. Can my employer make me see a therapist of their choice?","If this is a concern of a few coworkers, make sure it is not something they see but you don't admit to.  Employers can ""suggest"" or something ""stipulate"" in continued employment with them  for you to go to their Employment Assistance Provider (EAP) if they have noticed the same behavior and concerned of how it is effecting productivity or employee relationships.  No one wants to work in a environment which they consider hostile.  Employers can be held responsible if they do not take action.Couple of things you can do...Ask a coworker in which you trust and respect if what others are saying is true?Seek professional help from your primary care provider or counselor if mood swings do exist.","It sounds like your coworkers are being dishonest.  To know what to do, I would suggest that you find out what the boss thinks of the situation.  It will be important to know how your manager perceives the workplace dynamic and if the boss's knowledge of your coworkers is genuine or just made up.  If your boss is just being nice to you, then you might consider contacting your doctor for advice, as you need a level head. It may also be worth telling a trusted friend about the coworkers. Sometimes talking with others about what is happening can help provide support and guidance."
"My boyfriend is in Ireland for 11 days, and I am an emotional wreck.","It sounds like you and your boyfriend are very close.  Do you typically spend most of your time together?  If so, it may be important to reflect on how you feel when you are apart.  If any separation is difficult, you may need to examine why.  Think about what it is that you miss and what you are anxious, upset or worried about.  If you examine the causes of your distress you likely will experience some relief.   It is important to learn how to be happy when you are alone, it will only improve the way you feel when you are with your boyfriend.","What do you feel most is missing to the situation?  Is it that he is going somewhere else than where you both can stay?  Is it that he is not doing his job, or is it he is not doing his work for you? Is it the unknown place, or the lack of a safe space to be. The idea of being somewhere else for 11 days is very strange for one and a half years. We are in a strange place with no clear plan, what do you have to offer him? Is your job more secure?  We do not know that for certain, but it's something we can look at, even if it feels small. The good news is that you are trying to understand this, which is awesome. It would be amazing if you could be sure that he will be more than happy for you to be there.  He might be happy to be out of the country, maybe to spend time with his family.  If the first two options are not to be satisfied, then this is a problem he is either not able to accept or unwilling to accept. You have to face this reality and understand your own feelings.  Does he want you, or does he love the idea of the place with him?  How would you feel to move back?  If he doesn't want you, I think the relationship would be very hard to change.  And if he does, will you also want to move back?  If this is happening to you as well, you want to have that same feeling and would want the opportunity to be together again.  But if he does not, it may be a place that you cannot go back to again. Would you rather move to another place to be with him or not?"
"When my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school, she starts crying and freaking out. She is a bright student, always has a 4.0, but I am afraid she is stressing too much. I’m afraid it’s going to break her. I don't know if I should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal.","Watching children go through challenges in their lives is difficult. On a very basic level, There exists a primal need to protect them from harm. The hard part for parents is letting them feel those challenges and working through them as they get older. At some point, there is a moment that occurs when the role as a parent shifts. Children no longer need the basics (food, shelter. water, safety) as much as when they were toddlers, but rather, their needs shift to wanting more support, encouragement, advice, and room to make mistakes. This is where the ability to communicate with them, letting them direct the sails to gather the wind needed to move, is so important. Keep the lines of communication open and be available to give feedback when they ask for it.","It might be a good idea to talk to a pediatrician or your school counselor. They can run tests and have a look at any signs of a problem. As for what to do for your daughter, I'd say that her mother should try to talk more about why her daughter is not so stressed about the school. Your daughter is smart and it would seem to me she probably doesn't have the same amount of time for her studies as you do to give her time to relax, to play or for her to do some kind of hobbies. If your daughter has not been able to calm down then maybe she needs some help finding a better way to relax. Your son might feel very responsible to worry about his daughter when she is feeling like a child. However, in the end your daughter's wellbeing comes first."
"It was over 20 years ago, but the pain has resurfaced again now because I have started seeing her Facebook posts about how great her life is. I feel so angry. How can I handle this?","Emotional pain is different from physical pain that way, isn't it? Even many years later, an old wound can be ripped open again by a small trigger.You were betrayed by two people close to you. That's a complex injury. I don't know whether you're still in the marriage or not, or whether your sister is still in your life. Perhaps not, as your contact with her seems to be through watching her facebook activity. I'm curious about why you're just now seeing her facebook posts again. Are you feeling more open lately to seeing how she's doing in her life? I guess if you were open to having your sister even in the periphery of your life again, you will have to figure out how to handle those triggers. If you can't, maybe consider unfollowing her or detaching from facebook for a while. So your sister is happy, or she at least appears happy. Your mind might go to some unhelpful places, like ""She doesn't regret the affair"" (you don't know that), ""She doesn't deserve happiness"" (that would be a harsh judgement), or ""She doesn't care that I'm hurt"" (again, there's no evidence of that). Where does your mind go? It's important to identify your worst thoughts in connection to her. When you have those worst thoughts identified, ask yourself ""What evidence supports that thought as truth?"" It's likely that either there's no evidence, or that the truth is so far from you that you can't know what she's feeling or thinking, which makes having those thoughts pretty futile.A therapist can help you determine what emotions are being triggered here. It doesn't help you and your happiness to carry around resentment, ill wishes, or the need for revenge. Forgiveness is not about saying that something was ""okay"". It's about saying ""It happened. I accept that I can't change it, and I don't want to carry the emotional burden around all the time"". Forgiveness is putting it down. She... (trust me this is true)...she carries her own burden of shame for what she did. For you to spend time feeling angry doesn't affect her burden. It only adds to yours. Can you find the tender emotion under your anger? You're hurt. Validate that hurt. Honour that hurt. Take care of that hurt. You can stay away from people who disregard your needs, and you have the power to forgive those who make mistakes out of their simple humanity if you want them in your life. If you continue to struggle, please seek the help of a professional who can assist you in navigating these waters. :)",It's quite common to have those feelings when seeing the lives of others. I would imagine that this is particularly true for people you are close to.  This is one of the things that makes our relationships strong because we want what others have.  I would love to know what else I can do to support you.
"I start to think of an issue that doesn't even matter or something bad that happened years ago. Then, I cry, pull at my hair, plug my ears, hit myself, and throw things. In loud public places, I get on edge and start being sarcastic and moody. I have an awful fear of people leaving me (which normally ends up happening) and I feel like I'm too clingy.","There is a reason you are having breakdowns. I can't agree that they happen for ""no reason at all"".   Finding out the reason is going to be your biggest challenge because that may require you to dig deep into your past, uncover hurtful experiences, or recognize something that would be extremely pain.  However, if you don't find professional help to carefully guide you through whatever you may confront, the symptoms mentioned will continue and may even get worse.  There is a light at the end of the road but you need some help to find the right road to get on so you can see it.",Is there anything that makes you feel loved and safe?
"My wife works late most days, so I'm lonely. I love my wife with all my heart, however I don't feel the intimacy we used to have. We don't have sex anymore, which bothers me tremendously. I have become close friends with a coworker, which I know is not helping. Nothing will happen with that, but there’s the thought.","First things first!  Friendships that develop in times of struggle may be a great emotional support, but also become confusing there's sexual attraction. And entertaining a tough is only going to make it a stronger target.  Careful with that friendship! You do not want to fill your marriage's void with another person.  Even when you are in a friend zone and not having intimacy with this person, you may be developing a special bond, sharing interest and activities that may lead to a deeper connection.  Ask yourself how you would feel if your spouse was having a friendship like that.Then try to refocus on your marriage. I suggest being transparent and talking to your wife about your feelings and concerns.  Ask her what you could do to reconnect, make some suggestions and dedicate time to practice them.  Make time in both of your schedules, make an effort to have lunch together, or to text during the day.  Remember that a marriage is like a very good friendship with benefits, but sometimes the responsibility kills the fun.¿Cómo puedo volver a enamorarme de mi esposa?Mi esposa trabaja tarde casi todos los días, la amo con todo mi corazón, pero no siento la intimidad como antes.  Ya no tenemos sexo, lo cual me molesta tremendamente.  Me he acercado a una amistad del trabajo, lo cual no ayuda.  Nada pasara, pero hay pensamientos al respecto.Primero lo primero! Las amistades que se desarrollan en momentos de crisis pueden ser un gran apoyo emocional, pero también pueden convertirse en algo nebuloso cuando hay atracción sexual. Entretener pensamientos al respecto solo lo va a hacer un reto más grande.  ¡Ten cuidado con esa amistad! No quieres llenar el vacío que deja tu matrimonio con esta nueva persona.  Aunque no estés teniendo intimidad con esa persona, puedes estar creando una conexión especial, compartiendo intereses en común y actividades que los unen más aun. Pregúntate como te sentirías si tu esposa tuviera una amistad así.Intenta reenfocarte en tu matrimonio.  Sugiero que seas transparente con tu esposa y le dejes saber tu preocupación y como te sientes con el distanciamiento.  Pregúntale que le gustaría hacer para reconectarse, sugiérele algunas ideas y dediquen tiempo a las mismas.  Hagan tiempo en sus agendas para ustedes, hagan un esfuerzo para almorzar juntos, y comunicarse durante el día, aunque sea con textos.  Recuerda que el matrimonio es como una muy buena amistad con beneficios y muchas veces las responsabilidades matan la diversión.","I would strongly advise you to take a break from that coworker. Being friends with people can make you feel that your relationship is a social arrangement rather than a love relationship. If you have a fear that something is wrong with the relationship, perhaps your relationship is not good enough for the coworker.
If you are lonely, focus on activities to help you feel happy and strong. If you would like to feel more connected with your husband, have he been working really late? Would he like to spend less time with his job? What would you tell him he needed to do with his job to feel more less stressed?"
"My boyfriend shows affection, but I just push him away. Every time my boyfriend tries to kiss, hug, or touch me I almost always push him away. I'm on birth control and it has killed my sex drive.     I love him so much. Why do I do this?","There could be many reasons that you push your boyfriend away. It could be part of how you were raised, it could be because of culture, it could even be your own insecurities about yourself that are then outwardly manifested in you ""pushing"" him away. What is important in all this is that you both find a way to connect. So what if you aren't a hugger, a kisser, or a toucher you have to find what works for the both of you and your relationship. There are many ways to show affection that aren't physical (words of affirmation, giving of time and/or gifts, etc). If your boyfriend wants the physical attention then work on ways that are comfortable for the both of you making sure to start out slow and to work your way up to more physical touching.","This sounds like a tricky situation. Birth control is definitely working on your desire. A lot of times this is because of fear for the future of your relationship.  It is very common for women to fear the loss of intimacy in a relationship.  Even though some women are willing to prioritize their need to focus on a man, they often know this will likely end the relationship in that context. Sometimes, even with the most well intentioned efforts, intimacy, and sex are not as appealing to someone as it was when they were younger and in love. This may be due to changes in the brain and mood. Or sometimes women experience their sexuality differently during this period in their lives.I would suggest that you talk to him about your desire to have more intimacy. You could maybe start by talking about the possibility of having sex without birth control. It will be hard to ask this, but that might be the best way for him to know that he will need to change as well.  Ultimately, you know what is best for yourself."
I haven't been feeling like myself lately. I've been upset for no reason and feeling anxious. I'm feeling burnt out. What can help me feel better?,"Does it help to put a name to the experience you are having? Where you first said, ""I've been upset for no reason and feeling anxious,"" you then say that you are ""feeling burnt out,"" which gives a little more context to what may have once felt like ""no reason."" Perhaps you are feeling burnt out! That is a big deal, and please try not to take it lightly! When we get burnt out, I have found that it's from one of two things: either we are not doing what we want, or we are doing too much (either of something we want or something we don't, doesn't really matter once we get into doing too much.)If either of those rings true for your experience, try as much as possible to sit with the experience and get a better sense of where the burn out is coming from. I wrote about burnout for a newsletter and it is on my website. I don't want to do shameless promotion, but I thought it could also add to helping you: https://davidkleintherapy.com/my-experiences-with-burnout/I hope that you can also see that it's not an abnormal experience.","There are a lot of symptoms I'm noticing that are going with the problem of not feeling like yourself. If we start looking for a few things about you that aren't quite the same as what's happening here, maybe those will give us some direction.  I'm thinking about what's causing it to happen and some things we could do about it as a first step: 
First, if you do have any of the symptoms that we've talked about, let me know. I can offer some insight as to how to talk with your doctor to see if you can do any other work and what the future looks like.  Next, how is your mental health at the present?  For me, there isn't much to find out here.  If you can't even tell me a little bit about yourself, that's fine, but I'd like to find out some things about you to begin with. Do you have any pets or live in a neighborhood where it's normal for people to know a bit about each other?  What kind of music do you like?  You don’t have to give me an answer if you don't want to!  If you want to use a self-help tool like those things to start out, feel free,  and I'll be happy to help you start.  I'm here for you. Let me know if you want to talk, or just have a space to write down those thoughts and let them go!"
"There is just no communication at all between us. She sleeps constantly all day (not at night). She acts angry and unfocused and stays in her very messy room all the time. The only time she comes out is to eat.    She has aches and fatigue, weight gain, hair loss and skin problems. She does not look after her health.
   I don't know how to communicate with her. She is not open to any suggestions. How do I get through to her?","1. She's an adult.2. She lives in your house? She follows your rules.3. What you're describing could be any number of things, but could potentially be a medical issue that needs attention. Thyroid issues, autoimmune diseases - there's a ton of medical possibilities for her symptoms. I'm not a doctor; this is a forum of therapists.4. I recommend the book ""Codependent No More"" which may help you navigate your rocky relationship with your adult daughter. You may be inadvertently making things worse by ""helping"" her which can instead enable her to continue her behaviors. Another book you may find helpful is ""Boundaries: Where you end and I begin"". You cannot control another person, especially an adult. The only person you can control is yourself. Tough love is sometimes needed, and she is an adult - treat her like one. Maybe then she'll act like one. If we were having this conversation in person, you would interrupt me at this point with a ""but..."" and then explain all the reasons why you can't tell her to move out, get a job, get up and cook or clean the house, etc. I already know that you have a myriad of excuses for things being the way they are. Yes, I said excuses instead of reasons, because that's what they are. You may feel stuck and like you have to take care of her, but you have choices - you just may not like them. I know that when children are small, parents' lives are focused around them (some more than others) and decisions are made around what is best for your child. But you said your daughter is an adult. The relationship dynamics must change if the relationship is to be a healthy one. I know how difficult it is to watch your child make life choices that you wouldn't want for them, no matter what that choice may be. As a parent, we want to force them to do what we think is ""the right thing"" but trying to do that only results in frustrations for everyone involved. Whether the issue is a hair color, a tattoo, a lifestyle choice, a job, or choosing not to work or take care of their health, or doing drugs, or drinking - the choice is theirs and theirs alone and so are the consequences of those choices.","The sound of her crying and angry sounds like an adult child in the presence of their parents. There is a very specific issue and a very clear way of communication.   First, it is the sound of her crying. Is she actually crying? If so, how many times in one day? And whether she cries at other times too? Have you noticed there are times that she does cry more than others? These seem to be the times that she's most aware of what is going on. She has no way of know that she is upset, and that it is her fault. She does not know she is becoming more agitated, when that starts and how it gets to be so. Maybe something is triggering her. It may not be related to food intake because she has not looked after her health. If this sounds like an adult child in the presence of parents, then we know that we need to talk to the parents and talk to her in some way about what might be happening. Have you talked to the parents? Are they able to help? It could be a good idea to discuss an outcome for the kids in this situation, such as food allowances if the family is able to afford it, physical activity, or social interaction."
My two adult sons live with me. One has been having panic attacks and hasn't been able to work for over 6 months. He doesn't want to get help. I'm feeling so overwhelmed. What can I do?,"My very first thought is this is so much to carry on your own!  A mother's instinct is to care for her children so I can imagine how hard it must be to see your son in pain and struggling.  I hear a ping of helplessness in there as well.  That's heavy.My question is: who is supporting you?  I know nothing about the context, but I wonder if the role you hold often is that of caretaker.  It may not be that the end-all-be-all answer is to be cared for, but the absence of care (or even self-care) can seem like we are only existing for others.  Sometimes having someone to rely on can help take off some of the edge--the pressure--of all that is overwhelming.Despite that, it may be that the situation continues to be exactly what it is, providing a steady stream of stress for you (which would be so difficult).  I don't think anyone can tell you what to do because no one here has to live with those consequences, good or bad.  Just a note that sometimes with men it is harder to reach out for help.  Perhaps he feels comfortable enough for you to know he's struggling (which means you have provided him a safe space to do just that) but not comfortable enough to interact with a stranger about those same struggles.  Men often avoid therapy because it's seen as weak and/or means you need help.  Planting seeds here is sometimes all you can do, as hard as that is.As far as supporting goes, there's much more you can do there if he is ready to receive that.  If you are seeing him in the midst of panic, the best thing you can do is let him know you are there for him.  Maybe that means being there physically, or continuing to give him encouragement along the way (e.g., ""You got this"", ""I know this is hard"", etc.).  If you aren't present for the attacks but he's telling you about them, you can ask what you can provide for him in those moments or how you can help him afterward.  Panic attacks can be taxing on the body so sometimes people need time to recover.  Remember that you also need to recover here, too.  It's very painful to watch someone you love panic.  What might you need there?Of course, counseling can be a great place to work through that stress and overwhelm.  That time is all for you to be heard and understood.  You deserve to have someone there for you, too!","It sounds like you are experiencing many stressors in your life right now, and it's great you are trying to deal with this. I would make sure to listen to what is happening in your life and in the world around you and to really try to help your son to deal with the circumstances around him. You may need to speak with him in a supportive, empathetic way, offering your support.  You might want to see a therapist to come up with a plan for his recovery, or to help him seek the help that he will need. In the meantime, it is okay to ask for support for yourself, or ask the rest of your family for support. It’s a team effort to help your son to get through this and continue to have the support he needs. If he isn't going to be receptive to help, then seek out support for yourself as well. You also need to ask yourself how you have dealt with stressful events in the past, and how you were able to get through them. Are there any patterns in what has been helpful for you and which things have not been helpful for you? Working on a support system will hopefully help with your son's recovery and help you in the same way.If your son is a young man who is likely to grow up in a supportive and encouraging environment, and you would agree to follow a set of strategies for him to help him to move forward, then I hope this is in your best interest too. In any case, it may be a great way to help your son to continue to be able to move forward as a grown man."
"I'm a male in my early 20s. Lately, my paranoia about being around kids is causing me too breathe heavy and sweat a lot. I then start to act weird because I'm trying to fight my paranoia. This leads to people starring at me because they don't know that I'm suffering from panic attacks and paranoia. They just notice me acting scared around kids and they think I'm a threat because of it.    I'm not a pervert or predator. I would never hurt a kid. I like kids and don't know why I'm so scared to be around them.    I don't understand why I feel like this. Am I a bad person? How do I make this stop?","In our practice, many people we see have unwanted thoughts of doing harm to children - physically or sexually. As you said, these are intrusive and unwanted thoughts - not genuine desires to harm them. This is a form of OCD we often call Harm or Pedophilic OCD. What you are describing here as ""paranoia"" sounds similar to this, and is so demoralizing because you are dealing both with the distress of these unwanted thoughts and feelings, as well as the fear and uncertainty about your own character as a good person.If this is really what is going on (further assessment by the right professional would determine this), the current gold standard approach to addressing OCD is Exposure with Response Prevention - in this case, confronting the feared situations, thoughts or images on purpose, rather than avoiding them, until they lose the fear and shame associated with them.","Let's get one thing straight: you are not a bad person. You are more likely to be in the hands of someone who does. I'd like to give you a few things to consider and things you might want to try: 1. Ask yourself this: are kids or kids-at-risk really a threat to me? The answer is usually no. This can be a lot of help in knowing if it's about a fear and not something else. 2. Practice mindfulness. Meditation can help you be better aware of your thoughts and feelings. While mindfulness isn't a cure, it is a tool to be better at managing anxiety, and thus, to being less hypervigilant. 3. You know it is probably your fears. It does not mean that you will always win. But by understanding that you fear something and taking small steps to reduce that fear, you will begin to have more control over your mind. When you get a grip on your mind, you start to have a greater sense of control over your behavior. What's more, learning that you're more aware of it and what's causing it can actually be helpful in reducing it. Good luck, you got this!"
I'm very depressed. How do I find someone to talk to?,"You have already taken the brave first step of making the decision to heal from it and find a professional that will help you do so. There are lots of different options nowadays for therapists, as you can see them online or in an office.  My biggest tip for you is to use Psychology Today or Counsel Chat to find a therapist.  Enter in your zip code and you will find many different therapists you can talk to . Be sure to find someone that you most resonate with and ask them any questions you may have. Many  times, therapists will provide free consultations and this can be a great opportunity to see if you are a good fit.","Hi!If you've been depressed for a long time, a lot of depression can happen. Depression does not usually come from being ""depressed"". It is often a result of feeling confused or uncertain about a problem or the best way to find a solution. Often, depression and other things like anxiety and low self-esteem can be the reason that somebody thinks to find someone to talk to. Also, depression and anxiety can really mix and make it difficult to see the best way to deal with this.  Many people have a great feeling about taking care of themselves or what they are doing. Depression can be very isolating and the loss of self-esteem can impact that. I think that talking to someone who knows what the issue is can really help to make a person feel supported. It seems like you may be doing some things that would benefit you (not just for the other person, but for you as well).I know you may be searching for support but, I would suggest that you visit a doctor to have some extra tests done (blood tests). The doctor will be able to provide some good insight and what causes the depression and what medications may be beneficial for you.  I recommend the same for a therapist.Sometimes depression and anxiety can be a combination of things, which in turn might lead to depression. This can be very confusing for a person when they are learning to cope with the depression. However, these types of situations are not uncommon.I know some people have great ways of coping with it, but depression and anxiety can take a significant toll on the person.I hope this helps!"
"I don't know what's with me. I'm almost constantly angry. Even when I'm happy, I still feel anger inside me. When I acknowledge it, it ruins my mood and takes over. I get angry at the littlest things. Even if I think someone said something they didn't, it infuriates me. Something perfectly normal can make me go off. When my anger flares up, I get a terrible pain in my chest that lasts for a while. It's like there is a fire constantly burning in my body, and anger is gasoline.","Hi Nashville, I'm glad you want this to be different. It doesn't feel good to be angry all the time, and it's stealing your energy as well as affecting relationships, I'm sure.Working with a therapist, you can learn to recognise the deep emotions that lie underneath the anger. It's likely to be either powerlessness or worthlessness, and what happens is this... a small moment in the present touches on an old, tender, bruised emotion that we've simply felt too much of or too strongly in the past. We develop ways of avoiding these vulnerable emotions, and anger is one way of doing that. So, when someone looks at you in a certain way, or says something, you'd rather be angry than feel powerless, or unimportant (or whatever your kryptonite feeling is). In that moment, your instinct is to blame whatever happened, no matter how small, because that's the thing that happened just before you got mad. You fail to recognise that the problem is not the look on that person's face, or the shoe that someone left in front of the door...it's that you can't stand feeling something and you want to avoid it like you want to stamp your foot out if it's on fire.I suggest finding a therapist to work with. You can learn to take responsibility for your old emotions and find new ways to manage them. :)","Let me ask you some questions in order to get some more clarity on what you're experiencing as anger. First of all, when you say you are close to being ""angry,"" what does it feel like for you? What are some words that come to mind when you are in the midst of an angry emotion? Have you had your anger come on ""outsides"" or ""inside?"" When you have it ""inside"" then is there any place that you feel like you can safely release and let it go? This is something that we can ask about next time we talk. In the meantime, some simple self-care suggestions could be: taking a few deep breaths to calm your nerves and breathing exercises. It is not always as easy as it would seem for people to release and let go of their anger, but practice is everything.   \*\*\*I'm sorry for my question. It does not seem to be relevant to the question that I am trying to answer.  But I have the feeling that you are still experiencing some discomfort inside of you and in addition, you are concerned about your past and wondering why you might not be able to self-regulate your anger.  There is a lot of research being conducted in areas such as anxiety, depression, trauma, and relationships and it would be wonderful to have you help myself by finding the right way to manage my own emotions."
"I constantly feel like everyone is up against me and trying their best to shut me down. It's ruining my mood and even my whole self. I have trouble sleeping, and I keep having sleep paralysis while dreaming of others mocking and judging me.","The problem you describe sounds very wearing on your spirit.Are there particular reasons for why you feel everyone hates you?Have you been in a clash of ideas or opinions and feel yourself in the minority viewpoint?Or does your sense of being shut out start within your own mind, as though you anticipate that others will not like what you say?If actual conversations are leading you to feel left out, then evaluate whether to bring up certain points to the other person.Or, you may also decide that the relationships in which you feel shut out, are no longer worthwhile ones for you.If the problem is hesitating to interact because you imagine others will reject you, then maybe you can coach yourself into trying a small step toward introducing yourself and your thoughts to others.","My name is Dr. Rebecca Taylor, PhD.  I am a Clinical Psychologist working to help people with anxiety and depression. The goal of my work is to help you deal with the overwhelming situations that you face, while not letting them control you. Since you are dealing with these thoughts in your mind, there is no way for you to change how you think and, more importantly, how you feel.The most important part of therapy is finding ways to respond. This is what I would help you find in your life, but first, you need to find out what's making you feel so down. The reasons you're feeling so down could be very simple or very complex. You may be feeling like you're not good enough, or that the people around you are not being as friendly as they should be. Sometimes the reason we feel so down is because we're not accepting that we are okay on our own.I would have to know about your sleep, your feelings, your relationships, and even if you have any of these conditions (anxiety or depression) before I can help you move forward in treating you.I have the skills to help you work with issues of anxiety, depression, sleep, and mood and anxiety/depression.  I am interested in treating people in the same way that I would want to be treated. Let's talk more about your concerns.  You can also talk to your doctor and get a medical diagnosis. You need to talk to a medical doctor to understand what's happening.The key to feeling better is getting over these difficult and sad thoughts that have the power to negatively affect your life."
"I'm going through some things with my feelings and myself. I barely sleep and I do nothing but think about how I'm worthless and how I shouldn't be here.
   I've never tried or contemplated suicide. I've always wanted to fix my issues, but I never get around to it.
   How can I change my feeling of being worthless to everyone?","Hello, and thank you for your question and seeking advice on this. Feelings of worthlessness is unfortunately common. In fact, most people, if not all, have felt this to some degree at some point in their life. You are not alone. Changing our feelings is like changing our thoughts - it's hard to do. Our minds are so amazing that the minute you change your thought another one can be right there to take it's place. Without your permission, another thought can just pop in there. The new thought may feel worse than the last one! My guess is that you have tried several things to improve this on your own even before reaching out on here. People often try thinking positive thoughts, debating with their thoughts, or simply telling themselves that they need to ""snap out of it"" - which is also a thought that carries some self-criticism. Some people try a different approach, and there are counselors out there that can help you with this. The idea is that instead of trying to change the thoughts, you change how you respond to them. You learn skills that allow you to manage difficult thoughts and feelings differently so they don't have the same impact on you that they do right now. For some people, they actually DO begin to experience less hurtful thoughts once they learn how to manage the ones they have differently. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy may be a good choice for you. There is information online and even self-help books that you can use to teach you the skills that I mentioned. Because they are skills, they require practice, but many people have found great relief and an enriched life by learning them. As for suicidal thoughts, I am very glad to read that this has not happened to you. Still, you should watch out for this because it can be a sign of a worsening depression. If you begin to think about this, it is important to reach out to a support system right away. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. The text line is #741741. I hope some other colleagues will provide you more suggestions. Be well...Robin Landwehr, DBH, LPCC","The issue here is that you're seeking to change your state of mind. While those are wonderful concepts, you need to change both *your* brain state and your *behaviors* as well.  If you are trying to fix your feelings then you are likely in a bad place.  You're not even having the self-compassion and knowledge that you need to try and correct those feelings.  If your feelings become extremely and persistently difficult to handle, then that’s because you're not practicing self-compassion.  You need to treat yourself with the same kindness, patience, and tolerance that you would offer a friend.  This is a huge change, and it can be hard at first because you're in the habit of beating yourself up.  It also has to do with being in a state of depression or anxiety.  If you're in this state then you're likely not engaging in behaviors that tend to be comforting.   These are typically things that you might do when depressed or anxious such as drinking.    Or the opposite, or being more overactive.               \^   \^\^   \^   \^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^  \^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^   \^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^\"
I have always wanted to have a transition from male to female for some time now. This issue has persisted for 10 years already but I don't know where to start. I do not have the soundest information either.,Wonderful!  I am so excited for you.  What a huge decision.  I am writing from Toronto Canada so it is hard for me to direct you specifically.  I would start with two things 1) Find a doctor that is comfortable perscribing hormones and 2) find a Counsellor or Therapist that is transgender specialized.  They will know how transitioning works in your health care system and other supports as well.  Google is a wonderful way to find these resources.   I wish you well. Thanks for writing!,"So, I'd say you would need to talk with a doctor to find out whether you have any medical problems that could be causing your issues.  It would also make sense to have to talk with a gender therapist who is knowledgeable in gender transition and gender identity.  Not everyone has this kind of knowledge, but  if you feel that you would benefit from having such knowledge, it could be useful to speak to a social worker as well, as they are often great at connecting people with mental health services. Also, in certain cases, the fact that you don’t know what's going on inside you could mean a physical condition.  If this is the case, you'll probably need to see a doctor to rule it out."
"I think i may suffer from depression, and it is affecting my life and sleep. I am on my parent's insurance, and they won't let me see a therapist because they don't believe in it.","The answer here really depends upon your age and something called the ""age of consent"" in the state where you live. In Pennsylvania, anyone over the age of 14 can provide consent for their own treatment. As for billing purposes, try talking to some local agencies. If you are under 18, you may be able to have Medicaid out of medical necessity so that you can have treatment. If you are over 18, there may be some discounted rates at some agencies because of the situation you're in. Maybe your primary care physician will be able to refer you to some local agencies.If you are in school, you may be able to talk with a guidance counselor or someone at the school. This would not require using your insurance.","Thanks for your honest words in asking about being depressive. Depression can be tough, but if you are on your parents insurance and are unsure, you could talk to your parents about it and see if they'd be open to finding a therapist in your name, or maybe you should look into getting a referral. It may be a good idea to explore a few different therapists to see who fits you best. But the good news is that depression can be improved over time."
"My boyfriend is always saying he's done with me and says he's leaving, but then at the end of the night, he's still here. He wakes up in the morning, acts like nothing happen, and repeats this every night.","Do the two of you ever talk over why he does this or your reaction to it?Are you asking your question because his behavior upsets you or only out of curiosity to understand him better?Basically, first know your own reason for your question.   Then go ahead and tell him if what he does bothers you.  In the best of cases, he doesn't realize how his actions affect you and he will change.","Your boyfriend has a problem that is making it hard for you to enjoy any time together.  You would never really know until you had the time to just sit in the comfort of your own home. The longer this continues and you aren't sure of the real reason why, you may start worrying and you can start to feel this is less than love. Here is why the night repeats : One might say there is no reason at all; all that he says ""I'm done"". If this can be addressed as an emotion, then there may be a possibility to see a professional from time to time.  The fact is though that you are trying to work for a relationship you feel in some way, and if there are issues we can address them. If he says ""I'm done"", then hopefully you have the ability to recognize that this is what you want to do.  He may simply need some time and space to figure out his own feelings. There is no need to find an additional person or take his hand. He would love to be with you at a time when he is ready to have an opportunity to work on this."
"I'm a Christian teenage girl, and I have lost my virginity. My boyfriend is a Christian teenager too, but things just got out of hand between us in a sexual manner. I planned to abstain from sex but I guess I wasn't clear about this because I was also tempted and led him on. We continued to have sex. Does it mean that he isn't the one God planned for me? We're so young, but that doesn't stop me from dreaming of a potential future together. I really do feel like he is in my life for an important reason. I'm incredibly happy for I was able to escape from several abusive relationships because of him. I love him very much.","Having sex with your boyfriend is and was a mistake. Mistakes can be forgiven and you can make amends.But it is not the end of your relationship or God's will for you.Have a serious talk with your guy and get back on track with where you want to be. Talk to a counselor or your priest/pastor. Get someone to be your guide and mentor. Check in with them regularly.Getting back to square one could actually strengthen your relationship.Have a plan for the future where you will not be put into a place of temptation. Group dates, public places and no alone time where temptations might arise.Forgive yourself and move on.","When you have sex with someone that you are both in the faith and feel good about. There are many reasons why it can be such a high-risk time for a relationship. Sex and religion are a huge part of many faiths, but there are also ways of viewing sex and religion, that can be harmful or untrue. Some couples go through a period of ""trial marriage"" where they're figuring out each other’s faiths, then get married and follow those rules and values. However, some couples decide to live together for a while before they get married. If you have sex with your boyfriend. You are not necessarily ""bad"" or ""wrong"". It's about how you each feel about sex in this situation. I would feel your pain of living in a relationship which does not allow or even invites religious openness. I would think that this situation does not follow a religion-based expectation.  The most important question to ask yourself is whether or not sex in this situation is fulfilling your needs for a healthy relationship."
"They don't go away, and I feel like I'm going crazy. Does that ever stop? Can it be a symptom of medication?","Since you realize that hearing voices in your head is not usual for you, then definitely there is a problematic situation happening within your awareness of who you are.if you recently started taking a new drug or increased dosage of one you already were taking, and the voices started shortly after, then yes, it is possible medication created your problem.Start by telling whoever gave you the presecription, about the problem you're having.""Crazy"" has some flexibility as to whether someone is this way or not.Certainly a very positive sign that you're not crazy, is that you're self-aware of a problem within yourself. And, you're responsible toward yourself and making effort to address this problem.Crazy people usually don't do responsible behaviors.","I am not a doctor so if you're experiencing symptoms of medication or anxiety, please see a doctor or mental health professional.However, it's important to remember that the feeling of going crazy does not indicate that a mental health condition, like anxiety, depression or PTSD, is your issue.  If you are experiencing a shift in your behavior, thoughts, or feeling that is beyond what you're accustomed to, its very normal to have changes. If you're struggling with your mental health, and have someone you trust to talk to who can help you, please reach out to a mental health professional who can assist you.  The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) or the SAMHSA National Helpline (1-800-662-HELP (4357)) can help you find a treatment for the mental health conditions you may have."
"My dad doesn't like the fact that I'm a boy. He yells at me daily because of it and he tells me I'm extreme and over dramatic.
   I get so depressed because of my dad's yelling. He keeps asking me why I can't just be happy the way I am and yells at me on a daily basis. Is this considered emotional abuse?","Maybe this is emotional abuse.It certainly is irritating and annoying to be yelled at for being yourself.Maybe at a time when he's not yelling you can bring up the topic of your own willingness, if this is true, to discuss questions he has about your gender.There's no guarantee he won't start yelling midway through a dialogue like this.  Only then you will be on firm ground to excuse yourself from the conversation since you already explained that you're willing to talk with him and not to be yelled at by him.","I can imagine it sounds very confusing and difficult. As I was trying to work my way through this feeling of being confused and sad as I felt I could not cope, I looked at my mom and she did the same thing with me. I wondered if she knew I was sad. I wondered if she even knew she was being such a terrible mother. It's not her fault if my dad is a really bad person. I think both of us are really hurting in some way, maybe we'll try to figure that out."
"I know someone who is extremely sensitive to stress and very sensitive to a negative tone of voice. Sometimes during a disagreement he tells me that my communication is having a harmful impact on him. Once he believes I am being negative I can't seem to find a better way of communicating. In fact, it is often a self fulling prophesy because his accusatory manner becomes unbearably frustrating.    What advice might you offer?","With any type of criticism, it is usually best to introduce the topic at a neutral time, ie: when both of you are relaxed, with no current stressors involved, having fun, etc.  Begin with a non-judgmental reflective comment about a recent bothersome event, as if it were just then crossing your mind (therefore not something you've been consumed with ruminating over - eases the impulse for him to dive straight into defense mode).Then share how you felt at the time of the event.  Just say when.... I felt kind of hurt / shocked (or whatever the feeling was).  PERIOD.  THATS ALL YOU SHOULD SAY.  Wait for him to respond to your matter-of-fact statement.No matter what his response is, stick to your same message - don't get overwhelmed by trying to rephrase or explain your view as that will likely set you up for continued arguing.  You can even add, ""I agree I could have misunderstood  it (event).... I just know it made me feel uneasy.""Here you give him little wiggle room for a debate.Good luck & I'd love to hear how it goes!","There are several things that can be done to help with this issue if the patient and client have differing ways of communicating. What I would suggest is not to try to change him but help him hear how people's different ways of communicating do not have the same effect on how they feel. It seems like there is more going on here than just communicating in a way that doesn't have a negative effect on him, but also some unspoken reasons for it. One can only guess at these reasons from the first message that my client sent in. I am no longer sure how long he needs therapy to deal with these situations, but one thing that can help is the following: ""What is a good way to respond when you see that the person you are communicating with uses a negative tone of voice?"" Then, ""What would be an alternative way to respond so that the tone is different? For instance, instead of saying ""your voice sounds angry"", you could say 'I am feeling the energy from my voice when I'm angry, how can I handle it?""."
"My dad beat and mentally abused me so badly that I can't function properly. Letting go of the past is important to moving on and getting better, but I’m terrified to get better because I don't even know who I am without the trauma. I've never gotten to be myself. I don't even know who I am.",I am so sorry to hear that you are struggling.  Getting to know yourself after a trauma (especially at the hands of a caregiver) and learning to trust yourself can feel terrifying.  I would encourage you to seek out a trauma therapist who can work with you slowly and at your pace.  You are not your trauma.  You are good and you are whole.  Please seek out the support of a therapist who sees that in you.,"You are not alone in feeling like there is no way to get better. You would have heard your dad beat your mother and she could not see how well you was doing and left and left. You are not the first person to experience such trauma. If you got to the point of hearing your dad's abusive comments, I would not want you to think that you are being punished for not speaking out or doing what is right. You did the right thing to stand up for yourself. Your parents probably didn't think that much about it but you did, and that's what matters.   The important thing to remember is that these people were so in control of you, and it shows they did not care. You have the power to decide how you will react to your traumas, it is important to be aware that doing so can affect you. You have the power to ignore them, ignore them, or decide what you think of them based on your own moral judgment.   The important thing is that you are not alone, and there is a treatment that can help you heal from such trauma.   There are various therapists who specialize in traumatic trauma.    I would start here in an office and learn more about your situation. It’s great you're taking your own healing seriously because that will help you cope with it better."
I was violently raped by another women who was my friend of 13 years. I’m having bad flashbacks. I’m scared to sleep because I see it in my dreams. I don't leave the house because I have panic attacks.,"I'm sorry for your suffering.There are therapy programs which help people to gradually feel more at ease so that daily living does not feel so frightening.Once you feel stronger and more secure from such a behavioral program, you'll be able to sleep more peacefully and leave the house whenever necessary to do your regular life.Then, you will be able to open and clear the deep emotional hurt that always occurs from being violated by a trusted friend.Sending good wishes in your work!","A woman is the one who committed the crime, not you. Your life is not your victim's life, not your victim's life.  Your life is your own life.  You are safe in yourself.  The people who hurt you didn't hurt you.  There was no reason why they would hurt you.  Please find a way to forgive yourself.  You were doing what you were told to do.  You were being used.  There were others, they were used as well.  You could have done something to protect yourself.  If you had, you could have.  But you didn't.  It was the other woman's nature that caused the violence.  Not yours.  The police said the crimes were done by a woman.  I don't agree with that.  What you have to understand is that many people are capable of violence when they are unhappy.  So you will not be alone.  There are people who are willing to care for you.  Not so many at the same time. I know many people who have experienced such crimes.  They feel helpless and alone.  But not so many of us have the power to find hope.  Some of us never find this hope.  The rest of us find it.  You can find hope even if you don’t know where to look for it.  Ask people for what you need.  You can ask friends, family, and coworkers for what you need.    You are not alone.  I really think you'll find some people who care.  If they are willing, they will care.  There is hope for you.  There is hope for you too.  Your name is a positive name.  You're strong.  You have a life to live.  It does not matter how long and how hard it is.  I would feel better if I knew that you were doing something positive and not negative.  It does not matter if you are happy or not.  So you can be better at it.  You will get help with this, trust me."
I have dog obsession disorder and I am having problems with my girlfriend because I am placing more importance to my two dogs over her. How do I get over this problem and prioritize my girlfriend over my two dogs?,"Hey, dogs are cool. They adore pleasing humans and often LOVE to work on learning what you want and expect from them. Your girlfriend on the other hand, likely has her own desires and needs that she attend to before tuning into yours. You are good with dogs, that tells me that you've spent some time observing their behavior. The first step in working through this issue would be similar, start to tune into and observe your girlfriend more often... Observation is a skill when it comes to relationship building. The skills you have mastered in relating with your dogs can carry over, you will just have to relearn what behaviors you are watching. And keep in mind that also means observing yourself in relationships.","I'm sorry to hear that your girlfriend is facing difficulties with you, and is finding it hard to prioritize your two dogs and your girlfriend over your dogs. Here are some potential suggestions for how to work through this issue and prioritize your relationship over your dogs:

1.  Take a break: Give yourself some time and a break from the dogs. Your relationship should not be negatively impacted from the dogs' activities. If you are not able to take some time away to do nothing in fact you may be unintentionally discouraging your girlfriend from dating you.    You need to take some time away from your dogs and your relationship.    Take some time to get some work done, rest, or do something you enjoy.
2.  Have a discussion with your girlfriend: Express your concerns and the impact that your dogs have on your relationship.    What's your girlfriend's expectations?    What are your needs and expectations?    Discuss your feelings and how your dogs are impacting your relationship.    Your girlfriend's reaction will dictate the relationship.    If she is not understanding or is upset.    Talk to her about how your dogs influence the relationship.    Don't try to have a debate or argue over this.    Do your best to see the situation from her point of view.    If you end up agreeing that you can have both things.    Then that may be where you end up as partners.    Otherwise you have two problems which may have to be solved with either having one person be the primary decision maker or being able to compromise.    What seems to be most important to you?"
"Whenever I have to speak in public or be in big crowds, I freak out. I get light-headed, sweaty, and I have trouble breathing.","Basically, your response is the fight, flight or freeze reaction
which is hard wired into the human nervous system, specifically, the autonomic nervous system (called the autonomic response).  This system
is responsible for regulating the heart, digestion, respiratory rate
as well as other aspects which match the symptoms you describe.  It is largely an unconscious function, but
with training it can be managed such as a public speaking course in which you
prepare and even have some exposure to smaller experiences to help you prepare
and cope for larger presentations.  One of the greatest applications of
addressing this response is the NASA program which exposes the astronauts to situations
they will encounter while in space which will trigger the response so that when
it does happen (not if but when) that they are able to move through the
challenge with success.  You can learn
more about his by going to TED Talks “What I learned about going blind in space” It is
a truly inspiring look at what you are experiencing as well as how to deal with
it. 
With that being said, finding a program
like a Dale Carnegie Public Speaking program can help.  Working with a counselor who can help you
utilize visualization of an upcoming speech has been shown to help and you can
always talk to your doctor to see what options might be available there as
well. Good luck!","I am here to help you find a way to manage anxiety during public speaking. I do not know whether to recommend therapy.

"When I get around a particular person or when I go home, I'm just sad or irritated. The feeling comes and goes all day every day. I don't know what wrong. I'm not sure if I'm just making up symptoms and problems in my head or if there is something actually wrong.","Feelings are real, is very unlikely that you are making them up since they are a response to the thoughts in your mind and your daily experiences and interactions. Often we assume that feeling sadness is bad and that we should only feel happiness and joy; but all feelings have a purpose: joy, sadness, anger, frustration, excitement, anxiety, among others.   Is not healthy to experience the same feeling for a long time, so we should learn to identify what causes them and how to process them so you can navigate through life experiences with more ease.

No sé qué está mal.  No estoy seguro si estoy inventando los síntomas y problemas en mi cabeza o si algo realmente está mal. Los sentimientos son muy reales, y es muy poco probable que los estés inventando, por que los sentimientos son una respuesta tanto a los pensamientos que hay en nuestra cabeza, y, a las situaciones que nos ocurren día a día.  Muchas veces pensamos que sentirnos triste está mal, y que solo debemos sentirnos alegres, pero todas las emociones tienen un propósito y razón de ser, tanto la alegría, como la tristeza, el coraje, la frustración, la excitación o el desespero, entre otros.  No es bueno quedarnos estancados una emoción.  Así que es importante aprender a identificar que causa nuestros sentimientos, como procesarlos para poder superar nuestras emociones y movernos de una experiencia a otra con más tranquilidad.

Most people experience some degree of sadness or irritability when confronting someone or returning to a familiar place. But if these feelings are overwhelming, persistent, and significantly impact your happiness or ability to enjoy your daily life, then it may be helpful to explore more deeply the reasons for this experience. It may be helpful for you to consult a professional to do so, as they can help you examine and explore all the factors that may be contributing to your sadness or irritability."
"As a child, my parents injured my brother, so they went to prison. I was there when he had gotten hurt, but I can't seem to remember. I also can't remember being with them quite well. It's a blur.","It's important to know that there are counselors who are trained in working with survivors of trauma and you can get help.  The ""blur"" in your memories is your brain's attempt to protect you from the experiences in your past.  To recover them can be a slow process done by a trained professional that you trust.  When you are ready and feel safe, those memories can be recovered and can be integrated with other memories.  This will help to lessen the potency of the memory, help to make sense of what has happened, and allow you to begin the healing process.  Check into therapist who are trained in EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing).","The way that you've asked this question is the first sign that you're able to remember so well in your childhood. It's a sign you were around when it happened. As a child, when you were there and watching the other parent, you likely witnessed things happening with your parents that were not entirely clear to you because they were caught in the middle of family turmoil. At that moment, you were likely unsure of your place or how to react to events happening around you with your parents. Since as an adult, this isn't as clear as when you were a child, your memory may not be quite as full of detail as when you were a child. It's the reason why it's often a good idea for therapists to talk to both parents. If they can have a conversation in order to address some of the feelings that you may have in an adult person, then the trauma may be lessened.  Without this conversation, your memory has been obscured. If you can't understand why it's no longer clear to you, I would advise you to talk to a professional about it first. One that specializes in childhood trauma recovery, especially if that would be one of your parent's specialties. A specialized therapist, in this case, would be able to help clear some of the confusion that you are experiencing.  I would advise you to talk to some family members in order to get a better sense of where your parents lived when you were a child, the events that occurred, and any issues that were happening with them or each other.   With the help of a good therapist, the confusion that you are experiencing could resolve on its own.   The therapist would help clarify what your parents did, and who else was involved in your childhood.   As your parents had adult relationships and custody agreements, a good therapist could help you understand that your parents may not have wanted to be in contact with you, and that they might have been angry and hurt about your presence during and even after what had happened with your brother.    The first step is to know the parents, and what their past history was like.  It's possible they lived in a different country when you were a child or they did not live in that neighborhood.  The therapist can guide you to this goal.�"
I hate everything I see in the mirror. I don't like being in pictures and always scribble out my face. It's stressing me out. I don't trust my parents enough to tell them and I don't know what to do.,"This is so very common in this crazy looks-obsessed world! I meet so many beautiful people who can't see their beauty. Is there something getting in the way for you? Was there a time in your life when people teased you or told you something hurtful, or did something to you that made you feel ugly? If so, this can be addressed first. Sometimes stories are told about us when we're young and the best thing we can do is see the author's evil or careless intent and not take that on. A therapist can help you with this part.Once you've addressed any past barriers to feeling confident, you can focus on a few simple things. First, your thoughts. If you keep telling yourself that you don't like what you see, then you will never feel okay about your looks. Experiment with telling yourself something different. Look in the mirror and I dare you to find something that's lovely about your face. Focus on that. Describe what you see? If you were your own best friend, what would you say about your face? Eliminating those negative scripts and building new positive ones will help you feel more accepting of how you look. You can't change your face, but you can change your attitude towards your face. Confidence is the things that will make you beautiful!Accepting how you look is important. Without going to plastic surgery (the popularity of which is a testimony to how nuts this whole thing has become), you were born with that nose, those eyes, those lips. Accepting yourself and knowing it won't change is a good idea, because wishing it were different won't make it so!Looking good is also about minimizing flaws and building on your assets. Are you in a rut about hairstyle or makeup? Ask a good friend to give you a make-over. Play with your features and wardrobe. There are plenty of average looking people who know how to make themselves shine because they are creative!","The voice is coming from the mind and this may be a symptom from a broader trauma that your parents or someone in your life may have exposed you to in the past. However, not all people who are drawn to art are more prone to narcissistic traits, or have a history of abuse. The amount of self-focus from a person in art might be driven by both, and the type of art is just as likely to be of a narcissistic type as it is of a non narcissistic type, or a random pattern. It's possible that you are drawn to these emotions and that your parents do not recognize this. Sometimes, if we are seeking to do something that doesn't really satisfy us, we seek external validation. For example, you might be seeking attention in other areas of your life that are not serving you or that you might be drawing in more and more. This may come from family issues as well; however, if you have parents who feel that you are not fully responsible for your life or behavior, it may be a way to seek attention without yourself to blame. In your case, your own parents might be overly overprotective.  The narcissistic tendency to seek validation from others is more directly related to having negative attention. The self-focus in art isn't necessarily narcissistic in nature. Instead, the artist might be seeking satisfaction through self-expression, while the audience could be getting the satisfaction of connecting with the emotions expressed in the work. In this situation, you are more likely to get help than you would otherwise if this was a symptom of a deeper emotional struggle (such as a narcissist with narcissistic traits) and you knew you wanted to change a behavior, or feel more connected to your own feelings."
"I was hanging out with my close guy friend. We started kissing, but afterwards, he said that we should just stay friends because he doesn't want to ruin anything. We both just got out of relationships. His was very sexual. I'm not a sexual person, and he knows that. I want to be with him, but I'm not ready for another relationship, and I don't know if he ever will want to be more than friends.","Given that both you and your friend recently ended your respective romantic relationships, kissing each other sounds like each of you satisfied a very natural need which for right now does not has a natural source of satisfaction.Suddenly being without a partner is difficult because a relationship absorbs and offers much of a person's energy. Stay focused on what you know about yourself, which is that you're not ready for another relationship.From what you describe about your friend, similar to you, he does not feel ready for a new relationship.If and when you feel ready to enter a new relationship and your friend seems attractive, then you'll be in a position to find out, either by approaching your friend as a potential partner, or by asking your question of his interest in you.Who knows?It is possible your friend will feel ready for a new relationship, approach you, and depending on your personal wishes to be or not be with who he has become, accept his offer.Good luck with Step One, becoming familiar with your new state of single hood, and sorting through the good news and bad news of your most recent relationship.","I hope you're able to take your time to decide which relationship path best suits you and your feelings in the long term. It's not that the decision is a bad one to have. We know that these feelings and questions we have often arise when we are young and still learning to know what makes us feel safe in our lives. It can also be that we don't know what we want the rest of our lives to look like yet. We tend to have our assumptions about where we will end up in our lives based off our past relationships and whether we've had some experiences in the past that feel like they're important or not.  I wonder how many people are on this road to feeling this choice with each other. Is there a place out there where all couples, no matter how well-they-feel-each-other, can find a way to see if they are truly in love and the love that they have with the person being loved?   If so, there is an idea. You might need to find a therapist to ask them if they believe there is a way to be in this kind of relationship (one that is still loving but a new relationship in the sense that it is a new phase in your life) but may not see you as the best person for the job! However, there is also that theory that you're in love with the person, which is awesome. A lot of people love someone because they're good to them. I wonder if you could be so good to your friendship with him? If so, maybe that can help you build your ability to trust and love others? You can spend time on activities to help foster your self confidence, which can help you be able to get in touch with your feelings. Sometimes it can be hard to ask for things from others. It is more difficult when those things that have to do with love are involved, which is why you may be wondering if your friend will like you?   I hope you can talk to him about the things that you feel are important for you to be happy. The last thing you need to be worried about is what you may do to prove how much you love your friend. I encourage you to spend more time with your best friend in general, and really see how good he makes you feel and focus on the good stuff you have with him.  The whole point of building a relationship is to love, support and cherish each other. I wonder if"
"My mother has quite severe, undiagnosed OCD, diagnosed posttraumatic stress disorder, and maybe other mental health issues. She is weeks away from moving in with me, my husband, and our three children. I love my mother, but once she gets within her own area, she begins to tape all cracks and crevasses. She cannot tolerate any smells.","One way to handle the situation is to develop willingness to tolerate her unusual habits.  Would you be willing to talk with your kids that grandma is sensitive to smells and her way to address this is to tape up cracks and crevasses?As long as her behavior isn't aggressive, harmful to anyone, unethical or immoral, and you'd like her to live with you, then someone both sides need to be happy with the living condition.Also, if you haven't already done so, negotiate with your mom that the common family areas are off limits to taping the the cracks.  As part of adjusting to living with your family it is reasonable to expect she respect common areas and to limit her taping habit to her private sections within the house.Approach the matter fairly and with the expectation to satisfy all the people who are affected.","First, I am glad you have your mother's loving support.  A good therapist can help you all work towards a better situation in the future. Let me write down the next few questions that you can bring up.   What do you think your mother is so afraid of?   What are the symptoms of the disorder in your mother's life?   In a way, OCD, PTSD, and other mental disorders all have similar symptoms.   Would you like me to help you find some more information on the disorders that you have mentioned? Let us work with you to make the future look more and more positive for the whole family."
I am in my 30s with 2 kids and no job and I'm behind on the bills. I've been trying everything with no results. I feel like everyone else puts their needs in front on mine. I give intil it hurts and I'm afraid that I'm going to fail my babies    I've been struggling for 5 yrs in a relationship with no communication and no alone time. How can I get some support?,"Financial stability is probably a good place to start your new life project.If your partner doesn't work or doesn't contribute his money to the household bills, then maybe you are eligible  for some type of stipend from the government.Especially since you have kids the child welfare service may intervene to help you.  Sometimes too, a partner who is unwilling to pay for their kids' wellbeing may be pressured by child welfare to make regular contributions to you and your kids.I''m glad you are thinking of your needs and those of your kids.  This is the philosophy which will show you what road to follow so all three of you are in a secure financial place.","Hi Hope! I can tell you a lot about you that is very valid, I'm an old teacher and I am sure that the emotional intelligence I've learned over the years have been very helpful. You have to really focus on youself and listen to your feelings so that the ""you"" you feel is truly important. I hope that one day you can get your life sorted."
"I'm an adult, facing problems with my mom. She's way too controlling. She decides things for me, disregarding whatever I say. I tried explaining my side to her calmly, but she eventually gets angry and doesn't wish to listen to me regardless of how I speak to her.","The part of your life which is in your control is the way you handle what your mom does and the way she talks to you.It is possible the two of you have very different opinions on a great number of matters.Each person, including you, has the right to decide whether and how to respond to someone.Stick up for your own right to make decisions.If she doesn't accept your independent viewpoints, then this doesn't give away your right to have these views.Since she makes herself clear as to her unwillingness to listen to you, then consider this as an easy way to avoid directly speaking with her about what's on your mind.If she ever shows an interest in your opinions and you feel like discussing these with her, then feel free to make this choice.","I do wish you well. Being ""too controlling"" of a partner is often a sign that we're trying to keep our partner controlled for our own peace of mind. Sometimes a partner has a habit of being too controlling because they don't know how to communicate their needs in a way that is respectful of others' boundaries, or is just too worried about getting your agreement that they want to stop. But, for you to continue to be in a destructive cycle where you are told exactly what to do and will be angry if you do not agree? It's very reasonable that your mom is a difficult person to talk to. It is reasonable that you are able to have conversations with her but to still feel like she is controlling you, when she has not said or done anything so you have to agree with her, and when you feel she does not listen to you, because you are not able to get your point across and it is obvious that she does not want to listen to you.  But...it is worth the effort. You need to see if she does not have some control issues. Perhaps a therapist can help you to work through this."
"She's busy because her mom makes her clean all the time and go out places with her family. We don't talk much because of it. Also, we have little fights. We want to work it out but we don't know how.","Maybe you can start with having 15 minutes per week that you know you will be spending time with each other (even if it needs to be on the phone). Because this much time could be scheduled ahead of time, at least you would know there was that time that was set aside. That may also help you to rekindle some conversations between you.As far as your little fights, consider spending five minutes with one of you talking about one issue that is a concern and the other partner asking questions that are open-ended (cannot be answered with just yes or no) and listening as an investigative reporter to try to learn more about what the other person is experiencing. Then, once the partner who started speaking thinks the listening partner is understanding where they are coming from, switch. It's also good to restate what you think you are hearing. Then you know what each other is truly following about this. Also remember that following or understanding what someone is saying does not imply agreement, just that you are recognizing what they are saying and able to see where they are coming from.Also consider noticing what makes you feel valued, special, loved, or appreciated. Think of the same for your girlfriend. This could be a great discussion to have as well.","First of all, it sounds as if you are aware of the situation - and that you see it as a problem.  ""We want to work it out"" does sound right, but it is difficult to know how to work the problem out when there is a conflict at the root of it (maybe she's worried about your care or someone else's)."
How do I stop those thoughts?,"The thoughts you are having are just thoughts.  Not actions.  It is your choice whether you act on these thoughts.  If you decide to explore having sex with adults of different genders that is great.  If you find yourself obsessed with sexual thoughts, you may want to see a cognitive-behavioural therapist.  Take care.","Your statement makes a good point. All thoughts, no matter how negative they are or seem good, contain some truth, however little that truth may be at that moment.  In this instance, it seems that the narrator has an overly critical, negative, and potentially unrealistic voice in their head. These aren't necessarily harmful; in fact, they are often a part of a healthy part of the human experience.  In fact, a healthy dose of self-criticism is actually a part of human psychology.  It allows you to recognize and respond to errors.  However, your thoughts appear to be operating on a very low frequency, like a ""noise"" to your mind. Your brain is good at filtering, but it isn't always at the level of a therapist's working model of how we process emotions.  One of the main things we can do is to try and slow the process of thinking before you let it fully take hold.  Instead, try to gently label your thoughts (what are you thinking?) and change the way you are framing them.  For example, if you have a thought like ""I'm so stupid I failed to finish my project"" you can switch to thinking ""I worked really hard on this, and I do have an error in this project, I need to make sure I review my methods, and go to my supervisor for help."" This shift allows you to change the way you think.  The key is to work on one thing at a time and to be patient! The goal is to help you see the 'noise' and switch it to a much less annoying sound.  If this is something you'd like to explore further, my recommendation is that you find a therapist who specializes in this area, and explore the thought-stopping techniques they are teaching to you."
"My fiancée suffers from severe anxiety and depression. She has had it most of her life. Her anxiety in public places is the worst. It gets to points where she can't breathe or move. Sometimes, she won't even go to the restroom, so she will hold in her pee until her stomach hurts or she pees herself. She curls up in corners at the mall and has panic attacks. She won't eat or drink in public. If she isn't having a panic attack or crying, she's clinging to me and avoiding everything and everyone. Her depression flares up out of nowhere and causes her to become very suicidal and self-harming. She get really sick from anxiety and scared to the point that I can't even get her to eat, drink, leave the bed, or go outside. She always tells me how she grew up around so much fighting and fear that it makes her scared of loud sounds, yelling, conflict, and even talking to strangers in public. She will refuse to go to a store unless I am with her to talk to the cashier for her. She is so scared that I can't even get her to drive. She doesn't want to get her license because she's scared of trying to drive.
   Some people have recommended medication, but I believe it's just going to cover up her illness and not solve it. I don't want my fiancée pumped with drugs. I believe a psychiatric service dog would be the best bet for her. When we first met my poodle, it would calm her down a lot. She took the dog out every time we went out, and she seemed much calmer and happier. She slowly would eat, and the dog seemed to make her feel a lot better. I am worried and want to help her without medication.","It sounds like you have been a positive support for your fiancee. There is no doubt that this situation is a great challenge for the both of you. While it may feel like you are responsible for her health and happiness, it is important that you understand that you, on your own, won't be able to resolve her mental health issues. Based on what you have explained, it sounds like she needs to get a medical and/or psychiatric evaluation. Whether or not she decides to take medication is her (and your) decision, but keeping an open mind about treatment options is important. I suggest that she see a therapist on her own in order to better understand and cope with her anxiety and depression, especially given her suicidal thoughts. You would also likely benefit from therapy, individual or couple's therapy, in order to address how you are feeling and best learn how to support her and your relationship. I wish the very best for both of you and hope that things will improve sooner than later.","If she gets into her medication for her anxiety and depression, it might be good for her to see if and how to reduce the dosage for a short time so that the effects are not so severe. As well, if she has any good time with her dog or the dog is calm in different situations, it might help her to calm down from anxiety. If I feel that she might not tolerate being out or looking at people in public without being comforted, I would seek some way that she can be comforted without having to engage in conversations to deal with these social situations. If I don't get her to leave the bed or go out on her own, I need to talk to her. I would try to create a very peaceful atmosphere of acceptance and calm that she can return to when she feels more secure, so that she will be free to go out by herself again."
"I panicked over a minor parking lot mistake. It was totally my fault, but due to another insurance issue, I left a note with an illegible phone number. Guilty over this, I got an envelope containing several hundred dollars. Unfortunately, by the time I returned, the other driver had seen my ersatz note and drove away. Since I cannot make this up to that individual, how do I atone for my cowardly act? I have been trying to do random acts of kindness in hopes that karma will somehow even out.","From your writing, you have already atoned for what you describe as ""cowardly"".Recognizing your action and trying to directly correct it, realizing your action was improper and demonstrating the willingness to take right action, are all examples of making things right.Since the actual driver is unavailable to consult as to their wishes on what they expect and feel would correct the matter, you did the next best thing and considered the situation from the driver point of view.","I'm sorry that your wallet was not filled with money!  I hope this is an example of a truly unique and rare occurrence!  There are many ways to be extra charitable, such as donating to charity.  You can also do a lot of good by donating to those in need.  The best method for you will depend on your comfort level and what you're personally able to do, so you can be sure to give back in a way that feels right to you.   Also, I hope you are able to focus on forgiveness - the fact that this is a misfortune or a set back is much more important than focusing on that.  It's great that you are dealing with this through kindness and empathy toward others but don't take on responsibility for these things.   It’s probably not fair to blame this on yourself, to put all of your feelings on that particular day.   I wish you good luck with this and hope you have a wonderful day!"
"I stress over everything. If I don't have enough ""quality time"" with my boyfriend, I start to feel resentment towards him. He has three children, and they are great kids, but I find we don't have much time together. I break down easily and find myself depressed.","Everyone has some level of anxiety - it's what helps us respond to stressors in our lives and clues us into the fact that we need to respond to something going on. However, if you're feeling overwhelmed by racing thoughts, feeling like you spend a lot of energy worrying about something specific or even pretty much anything at all, and you're starting to find that it's getting in your way when it comes to living your life the way you want, then I'd suggest seeing a counselor or therapist for an assessment for anxiety. Your other concerns, though, seem pretty ""normal"" for someone who is in a relationship with a partner who has children. As a married stepmother, I've been there, and as a therapist, I can tell you that the boundaries and communication skills you have in your relationships need to be healthy for you to feel healthy. Finding some support from a group of others whose partners have children might be really helpful - being able to hear from others that you aren't alone in feeling like this can really lighten the load, and they might have some good ideas for handling certain situations. Another option is to find a counselor or therapist who has experience working with step/blended family dynamics - because even if you're not officially married, those dynamics come into play whenever there are kids from another relationship involved. You may even consider couples counseling so that both of you can learn to talk about your relationship needs and concerns in a way that will encourage connection and strengthen your sense of partnership.","First off, it sounds like you're feeling frustrated with your boyfriend about the imbalance in your schedule with the kids. It sounds like you and him do not want to have a good time as family.   The first step you need to ask yourself is, what do you want to get out of this relationship. Do you want to feel good about spending time with him? Do you want him to treat you right? What do you want him to do to make you feel good? Once you know what you need from your boyfriend, you can communicate with him.  If your boyfriend doesnt care about the time you spend together, then he may be the wrong person for you, even if he treats you well."
What makes a healthy marriage last?,"This is a fantastic question. In one sentence, I would say the following:Recognize that while you and your partner probably have common interests and areas of commonality, you are separate people, each with different wants, wishes, and desires – if you consider a diagram of two overlapping circles, they may share perhaps a third of the circle with overlap to indicate commonality (could be more or less) and then there are parts of the circles that are not overlapping, indicating separate interestsAs for ways that may strengthen any relationship, even the great ones, this is what came to mind. There are certainly more specific unique answers or elements for different people as far as the details, but here are some general ideas:Try to have at least 15 minutes a week where you are spending time together and not problem-solvingRealize that listening to your partner does not mean that you are agreeing with them, it just means that you are saying that you hear where they are coming fromLearn to hold on to your own wants, wishes, and desires while also recognizing those of your partnerSet boundaries for what is and isn't acceptable behavior during an argument or difficult discussionDiscuss how having important discussions can be anxiety-producing and consider having an understanding that if one of you (or both of you) feels overwhelmed, you can take a timeout for a certain amount of time. For example, you may say ""okay, I'm feeling really stressed about this right now. Let's discuss it in an hour."" And at that time, go back to the discussionConsider what your partner's top three or four complaints about you may be. Check in with them and see how accurate you are. If you see validity in their responses, consider whether or not you may want to make changesDiscover what makes your partner feel loved, valued, appreciated, or specialRelationships are always in progress and constantly changing. Some anxiety around change is typical. Being able to effectively discuss the anxiety and actually listen to one another without being defensive, name calling, finger-pointing, or asking each other to change is a true gift.You may enjoy this quote: ""Connection is the energy that is created between people when they feel seen, heard, and valued; when they can give and receive without judgment."" ~Brene Brown","We all know how much marriage is an adventure! Some couples may talk about ""what we're looking for in a mate"" but I think it's about a combination of qualities. The first one is respect -- understanding and honoring each other's strengths, needs and values.  It comes in various forms and ways.   I think the next is communication--asking each other if we are on the same page.   We can't truly have a good conversation if we don't both really listen to what the other is saying! Lastly is compromise. Marriage involves both of you working together, as partners, to try new things, take risks, and create the life you want. These may involve disagreements, and it's ok to take a break on some of them until a plan is made for how to solve them.   I don’t know how many times I have to tell couples that compromise may not be a great option but that it is still something that will help keep a relationship strong if you both want it to be the best possible thing."
"Now that the other girl is out of the picture, our sex life isn't the same. Is it because he is still thinking about the other girl?",Or...better yet... Is it you still thinking about the other girl?  I am sure his cheating hurt you emotionally and may have affected your sexual performance as well.  Make sure the other girl is out the picture on your end as well.  Sounds like something the both of you need to have a calm and adult conversation about.,"This is a real mess. If he is still thinking about the other girl, then it is because he is still thinking about the other girl. You have to be honest with yourself about this.  If you are still with this girl, then you have to be honest with yourself about whether or not it is worth the trouble. If you are not happy, then you have to do what is best for you. If you're happy, then consider the relationship more seriously.I hope you find out your answer soon.   If you are looking to end the relationship, then you must do so eventually."
I feel like my time is going too fast,"Thank you for reaching out! That is a great question! As an American, I can truly say that I spend way too much time on the go! It is a proven fact that Americans live in a fast paced environment compared to Europe! I often ask myself, what if I only had one day left on this Earth? What would I do? Well, that is an easy question. I would spend it with my family! Easier said than done when we are living in a tomorrow kind of World, right? Its hard to focus on the now when we are so consumed in what tomorrow shall bring.Time management is a very important factor when learning to ""live life to the fullest""! In fact, this is a required course in undergraduate college now. Everyone manages their time differently and it is up to you to decide how you would like to do this. Personally, for myself I like to keep a calendar with a to-do list. I always place my most important tasks at the top of the list. That way, if I do not get through the list, I am not stressing over the little things. When planning your day, it is important you schedule work, eat and play. A much as it is hard not to work after getting off work, it must be done. There is discipline involved in this process. If you have trouble with this, then maybe seeking out some accountability such as including a coworker to make sure you do not bring work home once your shift is over or your spouse/partner reminding you that this is a time for play and not work.These are just some ideas that I am throwing out there. Again, everyone has their own style on time management. I hope this was helpful for you. Please don't hesitate to reach out for anything further!","I see you looking toward the future, and it's understandable for the idea of ""going too fast"" to feel troubling. The truth is you don't know where you're going yet and that is okay! The important thing is your present and future as you live them. You may be getting stressed about your time and feeling that it is all moving too quickly for you! If you do this, it's likely due to the fact that you're trying to accomplish too many things at once. You might find that if you break this down into smaller steps, you can see a clear path forward to get where you want to be. As you do that you will most likely find that everything is moving faster and not slower. A reminder is that your time is going by, and as it does, the things you do with that time are whatever you want them to be. Enjoy it!"
"I’m in a relationship with my child's father. I’m a really jealous person. We don’t go out or do anything with other people because of me. To keep our relationship going, I know I have to stop being jealous, but I can’t. How can I get over these issues?","It may be important to look at this as getting through something rather than ""getting over it."" If you're aware of the reasons why you are jealous, I don't know if they relate to this relationship or a previous one, but you could remind yourself of the differences if your feelings of jealousy relate to something from your past.Also, it may be beneficial to have a conversation with your child's father if you are both open to having a discussion about this in a way that you summarize what each other is saying so you are sure that you are understanding each other, at least to some degree.Also, consider what you may want from your child's father to assist you with this. You cannot make him do anything to support you with this, but you can certainly ask.What is something you could start or stop doing to move you toward your goal?","I'm sorry to hear that you're so emotional over what is happening in your relationship.I guess all you had to do was start to get to know your partner's family and friends in order to have a more complete picture of who they are as a person. I do think a couple of things would help you deal with your jealousy when in a relationship that is working with your partner.The first thing would be learning about your emotions and how they affect your behaviour and your partner's feelings.The next would be to tell your partner what you are feeling and what would be helpful for you to feel less jealous, or how to make yourself feel like you are not jealous.I think you are likely feeling jealous because you want to know if you love your children more than anything and you feel that this is what will prevent you from wanting to be with your partner.What can you do if you're feeling jealous in your relationship?I believe that if you can manage your emotions with a good support system you will find that you won't need it. I also believe that the best thing to do if you are feeling jealous is to try and talk to your partner about it.I hope this advice has been helpful.Let me know if you want to discuss other issues and ask me if I can help."
"My daughter was overly tired and throwing a fit at her grandparent's house. She wanted to come home at midnight and cried screamed said she said she hated her grandma and that she wanted to kill herself!
    We also have a new baby in the house i didn't know if this would contribute to this. How should I approach this?","You wrote a very full family context w many directions to examine.Do you know or can you find out what the grandma and your daughter were doing in the evening of the screaming episode?Is it possible the grandma abuses your daughter, or tells her scary stories, watches scary movies.  These are only suggestions of some problem between grandma and your daughter.Also, ask your daughter directly why she wants to kill herself and what' killing herself"" means.   Seven year olds don't have a concept of death being a forever condition.  Seven year olds don't have a sense of future meaning besides liking/disliking them.   Maybe the new baby is a factor.  Do you feel this is a factor?   Trust your intuition to tell you if your daughter is resentful of your new baby.Even if she is, I doubt a seven year old has the capacity to connect current unhappiness with the intention of a future action, including suicide.","It sounds like your daughter is hurting and needs your support. It does sound like a new baby in the house may play a role here. Please take a moment to reflect if this could be a cause or another contributing factor.  I can not give you medical advice, but here are a few questions that you may ask yourself. Has she been feeling depressed or anxious at all? Is she able to focus on anything at all? Does she feel like something has to be solved and she is taking on the responsibility to solve things? If the answers to those are yes, or many of them, she may need a visit from a mental health professional.  If she is able to focus on anything and everything, the solution may be her own (she needs to find what brings her joy and relaxation, and do that!) If she is not able to focus on anything, then a good idea would be for you to take some time to listen to her and provide some emotional support."
"I don't know how to have emotions. I never had any from my birth. Being human, I think of myself as a monster. I enjoy pain. I cut myself for my climax during sex. I think most of the time, I lie, even when sometimes it would have been easy just to tell the truth. I was in rehabilitation for four year. I have made love with both men and women, but it made no impact in my emotions. The books that I enjoy reading H.P. Lovecraft and Edgar Allen Poe. I go hunting every Saturday. I feel powerful. I don't enjoy the killing of the creature, but the hunt of it and to eat and drink the flesh and blood of the creature.","I'm not sure that you don't feel emotion or that you are frightened of the depth of your emotions. From what you write, the context of your growing up years had people telling you to not feel.  Little kids and babies don't remember whether or not they had emotions since birth.  This is information someone told you or was part of your family system.Possibly your family was afraid of their emotions or of you knowing yours.Similarly, your comparison of being human means being monster like, is not an obvious connection.  Besides, monsters are an idea, they aren't real.  They embody what someone considers the worst qualities of themselves or the human species.  Again, I wonder whether you've taken on stories you heard growing up about how unacceptable and bad you are.A way to start learning your emotions is to start in simple, basic ways to ask yourself what you are feeling in the situations that you believe emotions would belong.If on the first bright sunny and warm day of the year, you remind yourself to notice what you're feeling in response to this, you'll be taking one step toward awareness of your emotions.If someone buys you a birthday present, be aware of how you feel.  Keep adding awareness to situations and see if this builds an ease with feeling emotions.","DearAnon,
It seems like a very difficult process, because this is not something you can ""do"" or ""go"" into. The more of the trauma you have experienced, the more painful it becomes to attempt to change what was and understand how it happened.    The good news is, I will also know that you have not done something inherently wrong when you cut yourself on your arm.   Sometimes, we cut ourselves in an attempt to find a way out of pain, and we don’t have the ability to do so until we have an idea what it is we are trying to escape. The pain will be there, and you will feel guilty for doing so. We can work together to find a place to go in which you have more control over what happens and where you are in your life."
"He's been losing feelings and he doesn't know why. I love him very very much. He sometimes thinks I'm obsessed when I'm not at all. I give him his space and I make sure he's okay but sometimes I think if me and him saw each other more it would be better? I truly want me and him to get better, it's kind of hard not to stress about it, because the love of my life is losing feelings which is a sad feeling. He's a great guy! I just don't know why he's been losing feelings towards me. He's starting to put less effort in talking to me. At this point I'll do anything to just make us better as a couple. I tried talking to him but he doesn't like talking about it much. Advice on what to do?","I'm willing to bet that this isn't what you are hoping to hear, but I'd suggest giving him space. Ooph, that's a tough one, right?! I know. But here's the thing, when you keep trying to process and talk it out with him you keep pushing him away. He needs to feel like a solid and whole person (as you do too) to be able to be fully in your relationship. It's the work of being in relationship to learn this. I get that this is tough stuff. I wonder, outside of being with him, how do you soothe and calm yourself? That's the stuff for you to tune into and focus on right now.",The feeling that you feel in your gut is that your partner is not truly in love with you and is simply wanting to avoid hurting your feelings. His actions are not evidence of love to you. You should be the one to ask your partner about why he is feeling this way and try and make sense of it and see if there are things you can do to help him or with you as a couple. I would definitely recommend seeing a therapist with someone experienced in trauma to help guide you through your relationship!
"My boyfriend won't touch me intimately, he won't kiss me while we are having sex and he won't have oral sex with me. I know he has done this things with other women in the past. I don't know why he won't do them with me. What should I do?","First off, don't blame yourself or be too quick to jump to any scary conclusions.  Human sexuality can be incredibly complex at times (e.g., what turns us on at one time may not be what turns us on the next time). There could actually be a number of things going on including him having performance anxiety...maybe he had a bad experience with a previous partner that's left him scared to try again (we call this operant conditioning).  It could also be that he puts you in a different category than previous lovers.  Sometimes I refer to this as the ""hooker-housewife mentality"" where a partner somehow gets the idea that when we truly fall in love, we treat that one differently; almost up on a pedestal.  Drives many partners crazy until they're aware that this is going on and give their boyfriend/ girlfriend permission to enjoy both the naughty and the nice with them. It could also be that he's not even aware that he's not doing these things. If you haven't asked him yet, you might try gently approaching the subject when you're not already in the bedroom or trying to get in on and inquire what he most enjoys about sex with you (or has enjoyed in the past, or thinks he might enjoy).  You can also share your favorite highlights of sex with him.  Give him an ego boost and tell him what he does well while then asking him if he'd be down to go downtown.  ""Baby, it REALLY turns me on when you kiss me during sex.""If you continue to get the impression that it's somehow only about YOU or that he's just really hesitant to talk about sex in general, you might see if he'd be cool to chat with a counselor who specializes in sexual intimacy.","This sounds a bit like a pattern that is difficult to change. It sounds like one of a few things. 1) He has a fixation on some other women, that is not you in his mind. 2) You are trying to make him comfortable. 3) It is just the way he is.   As much as I respect your right to have your own body. As much as I respect your right to be happy and content.I strongly encourage you to talk to him about how he's feeling, and that he may be making his choices not out of malice, but because they may be causing you stress. It is possible that he is in therapy.  If he is and you don't know, that might be something to look into. In general, men find it very difficult to get a man to change this pattern, and some may even do it to make the woman a priority.  (Because he knows how hard it is for women to make men change).  Ask him if he is open to talk about it, and start with questions like ""how are you feeling about this?"".  As it relates to your relationship, what do you want to hear? Ask him to tell you how he feels and does not blame you for his behaviour."
Sometimes 3 times a night.,"Perhaps more dreaming means that you are making use of your mind to solve problems.  I find that change states, while sometimes difficult, are very exciting.  They give you opportunity to grow more rapidly.  So I say: ""congratulations!""  ~Mark (www.MarkMorrisLCSW.com and www.LivingYes.org)","To help you, my dear friend, I have an idea! The next time you hear an old person talking about something that has happened to them, it is possible that they may need to make some suggestions!  I really love hearing your insights!"
I shake and have panic attacks.,"One way to understand panic attacks is as a sign of feeling insecure or lacking confidence in a certain area or characteristic of yourself.The insecurity can sometimes feel overwhelming and this starts the sense of panic. One way to build your sense of security within yourself is to have a simple life and a slow paced life.   When there are many activities or involvements to pay attention, then it is easy to not give full attention to all of them.  This may trigger a sense of insecurity since in fact you may not have had sufficient time to study and know your own opinion about all of what your life is immersed in.A simpler life of fewer activities allows more time to know and understand your own inner feelings and reactions.To know more about yourself may help build your confidence and security in your ability to know and live what goes on in your life!","Your first panic attack was terrifying, and it is reasonable to assume that what you are experiencing is a result of your response to a stimulus.  It is normal to feel that way when you are afraid.  It is also normal to feel the need to panic, when the feeling of being panicked is happening in your mind and you're aware of it in your body.  Many times people panic in times of great stress or danger.  Your body has already trained you to respond to danger and you have a set of physical effects that you have trained yourself to deal with.  Your pain signals to your nervous system that things are not alright and that you need to do something to make it all better.  Your body is doing this for you - it's protecting you.  Your nervous system is trying to alert you to something dangerous.  When your body perceives something as potentially dangerous, you're going to feel a lot of physical discomfort and the physical sensations you feel can be very alarming.  You may be surprised to find the sensations you feel and how they're related to your panic.  These things are called ""fight, flight, or freeze"" reflexes.  It's hard to get outside of these reflexes, as that is your baseline response to most situations.  Many times people try to control their reactions to avoid being overwhelmed, which only makes it worse.  So, you have a lot of energy trying to control the panic and it's going to be hard to be in this for long.  These feelings and sensations are often all part of a process.  It's very important to try and learn to manage them.  I'm not suggesting you quit your job but I am suggesting you think about how much you are dealing with your anxiety, and how you can manage it.  Often, this will reduce the intensity of the physical reactions that are happening in your body.  You may realize that your brain is ""pushing"" you to panic more than you are pushing your brain.  Often the best approach here is to take some space and allow your nervous system to calm down.  Often times a short walk can help.  Often times you can have deep breathing exercises"
"My boyfriend and I have a toxic relationship due to his emotional and verbal abuse but he makes me feel like I could never find someone better, and that I can't be happy without him.
   How do I get away from this relationship?","I'm glad you recognize your own best interest and that your life will be much better without verbal and emotional abuse.One of the terrible results of being abused in a relationship which is expected to be loving, safe and supportive, is that the one who is being abused, starts to question their own judgement, rights, opinions, overall way of thinking.This happens because partners who are intimately involved with one another are very meaningful.  Regardless of how irrational, wrong, mean, selfish, intimidating, thoughtless, a partner is to the other, the person on the receiving side gradually starts questioning whether they are wrong for not accepting these sorts of interactions.Stick with what your own intuition tells you.There is a part within each of us which knows the truth of what is going on.Leaving a relationship is always difficult to some degree.  People are in familiar patterns of daily behavior, no one wants to suddenly ""be alone"", even if this only means showing up as a physical body, not as a truly loving partner, no one wants to start telling others about a breakup, answer questions about it, feel blamed, worry what others think.These are secondary matters to following the truth in your own heart.Listen to yourself about leaving this guy. Your inner self does not lie to you.","There are a lot of things you can do. I have never heard of this before in my clinical work. I wish you a good life and lots of happiness, and I hope you find somebody who love and respects you and more than what you feel right now."
"My husband and I had our first threesome recently. Everyone was drinking and he was on her more then me.    He and I talked about it afterwards and it made me feel better, and now I'm craving more of it. But before it gets close to happening I get this empty feeling. Why am I feeling this way?","As someone who specializes in sexuality and polyamory, I can tell you that your experience is incredibly common. It can be helpful to keep in mind that alcohol lowers our inhibitions, and for first time threesomes or any new sexual behavior really, we humans tend to enjoy a little extra oomph to our courage levels. That being said, it also lowers our ability to make well thought-out decisions. This combined with the brain rewarding novelty (new lover, new experience with our partner etc.) and maybe even some over-zealousness and performance anxiety could likely explain why your husband was on her more than you. My encouragement to you is to try not to overthink it at this stage. Now, IF you two choose to bring her or someone else into the bedroom again and a similar thing keeps happening, I would definitely push the issue and see what's up from his perspective.The empty feeling could be any number of things including:Fear that ""you're not enough for him""Fear that ""she's better than you"" in some wayFear that ""if we keep doing this thing, he will need it and what happens if I no longer want it?""Opposite fear of ""what if I now want her more than him"" or ""if I want the threesomes and he doesn't?""Fear of ""does this mean our sex life isn't good enough as it is?""....""do we have to always add a little spice to keep it hot?""Or like Robin alluded to, preconceived notions about what culture, religion, family and friends etc. say about what marriage and sex ""should"" look like.  I also agree with her encouragement to explore the empty feeling further and see what nuances of other feelings are in there...jealousy? insecurity? shame? regret? longing?  When you can identify and name them, they are easier handled. Some of the resources I recommend poly/ sexually open couples are:“Love in Abundance: a Counselor’s Advice on Open Relationships” by Kathy Labriola“The Jealousy Workbook: Exercises and Insights for Managing Open Relationships” by Kathy Labriola“Rewriting the Rules: an Integrative Guide to Love, Sex, and Relationships” by Meg Barker“More Than Two: a Practical Guide to Ethical Polyamory” by Franklin Veaux & Eve Rickert“The Game Changer: a Memoir of Disruptive Love” by Franklin Veaux“The Ethical Slut: a Practical Guide to Polyamory, Open Relationships, and Other Adventures” by Dossie Easton & Janet Hardy“Opening Up: a Guide to Creating and Sustaining Open Relationships” by Tristan Taormino“Open All the Way: Confessions From my Open Marriage” by Sadie Smythe“Henry and June: From ‘A Journal of Love’ – The Unexpurgated Diary of Anais Nin (1931-1932)“Personally, I find your cravings to be healthy and quite normal. The key is to make them work well for you and your partner(s). Robin's also right about communication being key. Some of the suggested resources above can help get those conversations started. And if you need further assistance, absolutely I would find a sex-positive, poly-positive counselor to chat with.Best of luck to you!Tamara Powell, LMHC","The feeling you're describing is a very common experience. The empty feeling you're referencing is usually referred to as an ""emptiness of desire.""  This emptiness has to do with how you've been feeling about yourself and the desire to live a life that is full and satisfying.  The sexual experience is a temporary release of energy and that leaves you feeling somewhat empty in your own life.  It is possible the desire to continue to be sexual is the cause for the empty feeling you've experienced.  Since both of you were drinking and the experience was fun, you are likely on the same page about what type of sex you want to have.  Sometimes sex isn't about the feeling of pleasure, but more about the desire.  As you gain confidence and you both start to enjoy your sexuality, the desire grows.  You may be thinking that by getting a little more sexual, you'll get more pleasure and satisfaction in life.���������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������"
"I never feel like myself. I can’t even think straight anymore. I start stuttering and I can’t remember anything. I always get nervous and usually talk myself down but recently end up fighting with, what feels like, someone else. I don’t know why I feel this way, but I hate it.","Hi Houston, Okay, something's definitely going on, right? My gut is to start with your family physician, because you have some physical symptoms. While it seems anxiety is a likely problem here, your doctor will hopefully know your history and can help you decide if you need some medical tests or some therapy. Without knowing more, that's all I can say at this point. Best of luck.","If you are saying that, it's probably because you are feeling overwhelmed. Most people feel overwhelmed and frustrated at different times in life. In your case, your anxiety and perhaps depression are causing it. I do not know the cause for that in your case, so I cannot determine why you feel this way. But, here's what is going on:   You say you feel like you're losing yourself and you can't think straight anymore. That makes me think that you are having a hard time getting out of bed and going to bed. Often, when we get out of bed in the morning, there are problems about what we want to do for the day. What are our goals for today? I am curious if you have what you want to have today for that day, or if it is something that you can just live with. The other problem is you know that you can't do that. You can't keep going around and around without finding what you want to be doing. But you also don't know what you want to be doing. If you don't know what you want to be doing, and I don't know what your goals would be, then I don't know what you want to do. If you aren't sure where to start, I recommend talking to someone about it. You don't need to know everything about it, but you can talk to someone about your goals for today. That may take some time, but the more you talk with someone, the better you'll understand what you want. Maybe in the future, you will find that talking with someone will give you the answers you are looking for.If you feel that you don't know what to do, then maybe it's time to spend some time on something you enjoy. This can be something as simple as going for a walk, or listening to music, or reading a book. You may feel more confident in yourself when you spend some time doing something enjoyable.If you're talking to someone today, ask them about how to get what you need in life. Also, don't forget the importance of taking care of yourself. I hope that this information helps you and I hope you feel better."
"The sounds of eating and breathing gives me headaches—mostly mouth breathing and snoring. It makes me angry, and I want to solve it myself.","Probably good to know in what type of situations you are, in which you are hearing mouth breathing and snoring.If you're sleeping beside your partner who does these actions, would have a different response than if you overhear mouth breathing and snoring from a family member who is napping on the couch and you are walking past them on your way to take a snack in the kitchen.Basically, if the person who does these actions which bother you, start by telling them.Depending on whether they are empathetic to how distressed you are from their sounds, or not, willing to change, or not, has a good deal to do with next steps.I don't really see any step you're able to take to solve that you are sensitive to human sounds from the head.One path I don't recommend is expecting yourself to ignore the fact of being feeling bothered, or dismissing your own sensitivity someone.Your needs matter.","First, how old are you and what have you learned about your body and self-talk over the years? Also, what have you learned about yourself in this matter? How does your body speak? (I mean both physical and mental. This can mean you can take over the emotional space of your body and take control of your thoughts and feelings.) Do you ever find yourself having anger and then try to reason with your self? If this occurs, it's worth understanding where the anger comes from and learning to live with it without thinking about it for too long. This way, your body doesn't get very angry at you again. I would suggest you start paying attention to your body when you're stressed. See if you are able to identify physical and emotional symptoms. It may also be useful to explore why you're so angry at your body. You might learn that you have anxiety. Learning this may give you the courage to reach out to someone or something to let you speak about your anger. I would suggest you start by talking to a therapist because you're dealing with anger and anxiety. Together, you will work on the other two issues as well. If you feel comfortable, I recommend a group work setting. This will give you a safe place to discuss these issues and you'll have an opportunity to get a different perspective. Most importantly, take care of yourself. What can you do that makes you feel better? When you're feeling upset, try and address some of the simple ways in which you can start feeling better. Like taking a short walk, going for a swim, doing some yoga, or taking a bath. This is a way to clear your head.  I have a few books on body language that might be helpful to read. By learning to better understand and respond to your body's signals, you can manage your own reactions and improve your mental health. I hope you find some relief from these two issues. We are here to support you as you get to know yourself and your body better."
"A girl and I were madly in love. We dated for over a year and were even talking about marriage and future plans together. She moved away for school, and we attempted a long distance relationship. We eventually broke up. It's been a year now, and I still haven't lost my feelings for her. I still love her the same way I did. I've suffered from depression ever since the breakup and have been unable to connect with anyone else. It's damaging me and my life.","Hi Boise, I'm sorry that you've lost this love. The fact that you were planning marriage and a future tells me that you meant something very special to each other at that time. It's different now...you're not together anymore, but you can't accept this, right? Good for you for identifying that this situation is damaging your life. You've been grieving for longer than you were together. Oh, but really you've not been grieving...you're stuck still loving her instead of moving forward. Unrequited love is a recipe for eternal heartache. Let's look at some possible blocks to moving forward.It could be that there's something unfinished for you. Maybe you felt hurt and you didn't have the chance to say so, or you felt you hurt her and you didn't have the chance to make it right. Maybe there's a burning question you need to ask or something else you need to say. Maybe you want to tell her you've never stopped loving her, and see if she feels the same way. If this is the case, you have two choices, right? You can reach out and say what you need to say, or you can stop ruminating on that question and let it go. If you reach out, there's no guarantee it will go well or that she'll even respond. Maybe write her a letter and don't send it (or send it...it might be worth the risk). Use the next paragraph to help you decide. Do you know how she feels? How did it end? Did she end it? Was it ended just because of the distance, or are there more differences between you that didn't work? Sometimes people are so in love that they can't clearly see that the other person isn't in love with them anymore. Use the information you have about what she wants for her life...can you honour what she says she needs? If she's asked for distance, you would do well to honour that.A key to moving forward: look at your thoughts and where they're getting stuck. Write it down. What bad thing can happen if you let it go? Or ""If I move forward, that will mean...""  Keep going...what would be the worst part of that?  This kind of exploring can help you identify your stuck place.It is possible that you've turned this ending into some kind of negative meaning about you or your future. As in ""If this person doesn't love me, then I'm unlovable"", or ""No one will ever love me as much as she did"". So your need to cling to her in your heart is your way of rejecting that negative message about yourself or the future. Can you find another way to reject that message? Try saying these things to yourself:I know she loved me. There is evidence of that.I was a good partner. There is evidence of that.It's part of life to fall in love and then have to move forward...I can do this and learn from it.Many people like me...that's how I know I'm lovable.It's normal to feel sad. I'm grieving a lost love.I want to move forward and not stare in the rearview mirror.I know more love awaits me if I can get fear out of the way.If this person loved me, others can too, (but not if I'm clinging to some old memory)These are the kinds of things a therapist would explore with you. I wish you well!","Hi!I think this is what your therapist would call a ""romantic obsession."" I think that the ""I still love her the same way I did"" part of your response is what this is. You are still loving her even though your girlfriend is over 3000 miles away from you. People are so confused as to why they feel that way, they don't understand that there are some reasons why someone would still love someone even when he or she can't be in contact with them anymore. For a relationship to be over, you both need to give the other a way to do that as well. If you continue to love her and give the opportunity for this to be her decision, she may come back."
"I met the first man five months ago. I have come a long way and do have feelings for him. I know he would do anything for me and my kids. The man I love is their father, and no matter how many times things haven't been great in the past, I can't help but love him. I know they both love me, and I love both of them.","The answer depends entirely on which interest is stronger for you.If the reliable caretaker man is not someone with whom you'd have fun, lively conversations, understand each other, be sexually compatible, or romantically attracted, and your primary interest is in someone who' steadily manage the kids, household, and finances, then he is the right one for you!The problem is you may not be happy longterm with someone to whom you feel no romantic compatibility. Consider the drawback if you reach the moment of restlessness romantically and are with someone on whom you depend to take care of your kids.Since you have feelings for him, then wait several months longer to see whether or not you can imagine yourself romantically happy with the steady guy.If the other guy who is also the bio dad, isn't involved with his own kids, then he seems like a poor choice of someone to be with longterm.","As I read your question, I get a sense of fear and uncertainty. I think you may need to consider why you feel this fear, and I understand that there may be a relationship with your lover and the husband of your children that has gone wrong. You also know the details from your own story, I imagine that you have some of the evidence that might help in resolving this confusion. I would make sure that you have a good support system in place for your life, as I suggest that everyone is more successful with the love and support of others."
"She constantly tells me what I am doing wrong. For once, I want her to be proud of me. It’s like no matter what I do, she does not have one nice word to say to me. She is always hateful towards me and always has been.","I imagine this is very difficult and confusing for you.It sounds like there are things for which you are proud of yourself, which is really good. I hope there are also other people in your life that are currently able to recognize the good things that you're doing.If you think your mom would be willing to go to see a local mental health professional with you, that may be a good place to have some discussions about the relationship that the two of you have. The reason I'm suggesting that it may be easier to have the conversations there is because sometimes the mental health professional can point out parts of conflict that are not easy for the people who are involved to actually see by themselves.If you want to try to talk with you mom to see how she is feeling, maybe she would be willing to discuss it with you. If you're going to have a conversation like that, I would suggest you try these things:Ask her if this would be a good time to have an important conversation. If she says no, consider asking her when would be a better time.Try to have the conversation with the goal of taking about five minutes to learn more about where she is coming from on this. If you can ask questions to learn more about that, you may be able to know more about what she is thinking and feeling.This doesn't mean that you have to agree with her, but just that you are able to hear where she is coming from.Try to ask questions that start with the words who, what, how, where, when. Questions that start with the word ""why"" can be difficult to answer and can lead to a lot of extra emotion.Try to summarize what she is saying to see if you have it right.If you want your mom to know how you feel, after you can listen to what she is saying and see if she is willing to listen to what you would like to say.If you're going to tell your mom about how you feel, consider having some points written down ahead of time so you can explain yourself the way that you want to.It will probably be really hard to listen to her without being defensive right away. I know I would be wanting to jump right into the conversation. Remember that jumping in right away will probably make it more difficult to learn where your mom is coming from.Also, if she says she doesn't want to have a conversation, remember that she has that choice.If your mom does not want to go to see a counselor with you, remember that you could go on your own. Depending on your state and exactly how old you are, you may need your parent's permission to be in treatment, but not always. If you need help to figure that out, try contacting a couple of local mental health agencies to see if they can help you figure out what to do if you want to talk to someone.",Your response is really valid.

"For the past four weeks, I've been having nightmares and hearing voices telling me of horrible things. They're not random voices, but rather, the voices of those I care about.","I would recommend that you talk with a mental health professional near you about the details so you can have some really specific support for what you are going through.I don't know if you can understand when the voices are saying, but I wonder how you feel about what you are hearing? If the voices are just at night, is it possible that they are part of a nightmare or a dream? If you recall your nightmares, consider writing them down so that you can remember their content and work with a mental health professional to look for patterns.One thing that may help you while you are awake is to try to stay connected to the room you're in. For example, take time to notice your feet on the floor, hips in the chair, and shoulders against the back of the chair. You can also try mindfulness techniques, such as noticing what is around you or changing your breathing patterns.

She is living with her boyfriend of seven years. He is in therapy for depression and social anxiety. He hasn't worked in all this time.,"Congrats on your upcoming grandchild!Does your daughter want you to break news of her pregnancy, to the family?Talk with your daughter first, whether or not she would like you to tell other family members.Also, given the other facts you mention in your post, if household and financial management are areas you feel your daughter is vulnerable, then bring up these topics too.Stay open minded about your daughter having views which are different from yours.","I am sorry for the information in my email to you. I really am. There is more to the story than this one fact. I really did have a lot of people in my life as a kid and it feels like the best version of me was the one who was part of a family. I think there is a lot of joy in being an adults, but I also find myself feeling lonely. I often wonder if I'm not good enough. This is something I've been told to work through in my life, but the only place I feel we're able to have a lot of room for this to happen in our lives are in a therapist's office. I might be able to get some really help in the session with all of the different issues and things that I have been dealing with."
My motivation has gone away. It's hard to get out of bed. I really don't know what to do anymore. I'm miserable. My anxiety and depression have taken over my life.,"Anxiety and Depression are challenging experiences to live with and to manage on a daily basis. I would say that both are challenges to overcome but solutions to living healthy and well exist. Step 1: Talk about it. With friends, family, partners, counselors, and other trusted people in your life. Step 2: Create a plan with a counselor to learn new skills that help you recognize and manage your symptoms. Step 3: Don't give up. Working on yourself can be difficult and hard at the beginning. Stick with it and you will be able to find exercises, tools, and resources that help you live well.","It feels like you're letting your anxiety and depression have a big impact on you and your ability to get out of bed. Depression has a special way of stealing an ability to get out of bed, you're not alone in this experience! I have found that sometimes it is helpful to start by doing something small and easy, not trying to do something big and difficult. Also, I know your sadness and loneliness are big and very difficult to see and get over, which is something that I think can benefit from a bit of self-care to feel happier and stronger. There are some great ways to self-care, I recommend a good night for the body. Do you have time for a hobby that you enjoy? I would recommend finding out the things that keep you busy, and doing your best to have some fun. I have found that my biggest benefit is when I feel more happy and less lonely.  I can recommend some books for you. I hope I can offer additional advice!"
What are the basic skills a good counselor needs to have?,"Here is a list of skills I use every session, and a short explanation of what they are:Reflecting: Paraphrasing what clients have said so that they know you understand themValidating: Helping clients to know that their point of view is valuable and rationalClient-centered talk: Maintaining focus on the client in therapy sessions, rather than a therapist talking about themselvesAttending: Nonverbal or verbal cues that indicate I am listening to a client (i.e., nodding, leaning in, affirmations)Reframing: Helping a client to see a problematic behavior or situation in a different way (usually only works well after they feel heard and understood)","I am not sure how to answer that question. I am not a counselor myself, but I do what I do well."
"I'm a teenager, and while I’ve never been to any kind of therapist, I noticed I experience several anxiety symptoms. I frequently find myself not going out and following my parent around the house. I can't go into stores (grocery stores specifically) on my own, and when I do, I have to be on the phone with my dad the whole time. I also forget things a lot.","With the way you described your anxiety, it sounds like you have different types of anxiety. I'm not sure whether you have anxiety of public places, large crowds, being alone  (sometimes called separation anxiety), or some combination thereof.One thing that would be helpful would be to track your anxiety and see how anxious you are (on a scale of 1 to 10) in different situations. Also, if you know what leads up to your anxiety, it would be good to know this as well so you can look for patterns.As for forgetting things, you could be anxious because you are forgetting things or you could be forgetting things because you are anxious. When you are having anxiety, certain parts of your brain are overactive because you are in a kind of protective mode. It's also possible that forgetting things and anxiety are not related.Something else to try would be to notice where you feel your anxiety in your body and put your hand there is a way of giving yourself comfort.Another thing about anxiety is that having anxiety can lead to more worry about having more anxiety. One thing that helps for some people is to go to the regular primary care doctor to make sure that there are no physical problems (just for the regular physical) so they know that there are no physical problems and that the anxiety will lessen in a few minutes.Also, if you are able to notice your feet on the floor or your hips in the chair, this is helping you to be mindful of your body and connecting you to your surroundings. During this in combination with naming your emotions can be soothing as well. For example, in the grocery store, if you are feeling anxious, you could say to yourself ""I'm anxious right now and I'm okay"" while gently shifting your weight from one foot to the other. No one around you would notice what you were doing and the motion may be soothing to you.Anxiety can have a lot of different causes and things that trigger it. If it is difficult for you to work it out on your own (which is very common), consider talking with a local therapist so you can have more specific ideas.Also consider making a list of people who you trust and what it is about them that makes you feel comfortable.","Hi. It makes sense to me that you're anxious about not going out and doing things like grocery shopping, so you're probably anxious about *not* going out. It seems like you're trying to control what's happening around you. I know that the idea of ""going out"" to shop/eat for something in a store sounds nice, but it turns out it can lead to some anxieties with people, people who aren’t from your usual area (a friendly-looking stranger who's always looking at you). In addition, for adults that are older and/or have more control over their lives, it can become quite stressful to be on the phone with their parents while doing something else. It's very easy to get caught up in the worries about a teenager not going out.  Sometimes the best thing that a parent can do is just let the child be a teen who makes their own choices...even if those choices don't always make sense to them."
It's really hard to not have negative feelings about friends who don't put any effort into nourishing our relationship.,"One thing I would ask is ""why are you still hanging with those {friends}?"" A relationship needs to be nurtured by both parties, it is a dynamic fluctuation between two people. I would ask you to question why you continue to remain together as friends, I always believed that a relationship should emit positivity towards all parties involved, if your in a relationship that is one-sided, it is inevitable that it will start to de-compensate. Never travel with the circus, never travel with fools, everything in life should have some positive payout, will things at times be negative, of course they will, but in order to keep something or someone in your life there should be more positivity than negativity.Hope this helps, C","Hi,
Thank you for sharing your question.I imagine you're in a situation where you're finding yourself with a friend who is really distant or unavailable, and you feel like you're doing all of the effort in the relationship.  If you're feeling hurt and not reaching out to be supportive, then you might want to question your role in the relationship and see what is going on with your friend.  It's not you.  Usually, the more your friend shows interest in your life, the more you should respond with interest in theirs.  If a relationship gets into an unhealthy part of its journey, there is good advice out there on how to separate and leave.  When you're separated, you should also ensure you've not put yourself in a position where you may never see your friend again.  Then it is important to find yourself a new social circle.
We can continue this conversation on your questions later."
"This is preventing me from getting a job. I have bad relationship with my bipolar mother. I am living with her but it stresses me out so much to be around her that I have locked myself in my room. I have no friends or other family to help me. I have no money for therapy, but I think I need therapy before I can secure a job.",A good first step would be to make an appointment with your primary care provider & discuss your concerns.  They would have resources available to help in your particular situation.,"As someone who works in mental health, I've seen first hand the problems that arise because of poor relationships. Unfortunately, this isn't going to be easy for you. No matter how desperate and confused you feel you are, there is only one thing you can do at this moment - focus on protecting yourself. What other options do you have? If you can get more money or some form of temporary help, do so. Otherwise, you can focus on protecting yourself while you wait for more funds or more options. Focus on simple things: get out of your room. Pick up some clothes and go outside. Go to the grocery store or any other shopping establishment. When you find something that makes you happy, do it. Just get up and get moving. If all you have to do right now is sit in a room, that is okay. Stay there and do what will keep you safe. Don't have to decide anything until you can do what's going to keep you safe from your mother, who is right now making you feel very bad about yourself. The next time you need someone to help you, go to the same person and ask for help.I hope you feel a little better with each step that you take toward the end goal. I know you can get through this."
"I am lazy. I am very aware of the problem and try to talk myself out of it all the time, but I never seem to shake the habits. I try to think of what it is doing to me and my future, but no matter what, I keep creating excuses for myself to continue the procrastination. All I'm ever left with is regrets and a low grade. I am at an all-time low in my life, and I'm not even that old. I've always been a straight-A student, but now I'm getting C's and F's, and it hurts me to know that I am way better than that. It's not even like the work is hard.","I am sorry to hear that you are going through such a tough time. It sounds to me like you are suffering from depression to some degree. Have you seen a therapist or talked to anyone about your problems? If not, I would advise that you do so sooner than later so that you can learn what is causing you to be unmotivated and causing difficulty with breaking the cycle that you are in. It is also a good idea to get a medical evaluation from your doctor to rule out any medical causes for your current condition. Most often, difficult situations that life throws at us, along with an inability to think positively, and break bad habits are what cause depression. Some things you can do immediately are seek help from a professional, schedule in time every day to engage in pleasurable (or once pleasurable) activities, exercise daily, and practice thinking more positively. Set a few daily goals for yourself and write them down each morning or the night before. Achieving your goals every day will give you a sense of accomplishment and can lead to feeling more optimistic and capable. Additionally, keep a journal to write down how you are feeling and what ideas you have to help feel better. Sometimes having these ideas written down make it more real and tangible. Know that depression is most often curable but takes work and a desire to change (which you clearly have). Once you start feeling better about yourself and your life, your grades should naturally begin to improve, as you will have more motivation and energy to focus on that particular area. Best of luck to you!","Hi. I feel you when you talk of a life in the past. At first, the past is going to feel wonderful and full of good things, and the past can provide you with confidence to achieve goals. At first, the way you describe the past is that you were really good. Not that it is possible to go back and do anything differently.  This is why, at first, it feels so good to not do anything differently.  You get used to the past and you start to forget good things. You are what you do repeatedly. And, in your life now, you repeat the same pattern of avoiding work.  If you want to do better, you need to understand where the patterns come from and change those patterns. It sounds like you are having fun doing little things that you don’t want to do. For instance, when you've failed on a test, you're sad. But don't dwell on the failure as long as you are focused on a positive goal you have for yourself.  If you are more focused on your success for the future then it's easier to push through the negative feelings and learn from the failures. If you are focused on the difficulty in the problems that you don't want to face,  they will grow.  Don't let the pain of failure make you feel bad about your ability to do anything else. You have been given enough privilege to do whatever you want.  But, as you are reading this message, you seem to be struggling with how you feel about it.  You feel, 'No, it's not possible to change' or 'I don't want to change', and you stop trying.  Then you let these feelings become the reasons that prevent you from changing your behaviours and how you feel. We all have problems, but they are never the issues. There are always solutions.  Instead of dwelling on the past, focus on what you can do in the present to move forward. You should feel in control over your actions in the present.  Then,  move forward from there.    You are at an all-time low in your life, but if you are truly determined to grow and change, you are never too old. You're just older.  I'm sure that the past is no longer a problem for you."
"Recently my boyfriend broke up with me because of my bad language. But he thinks I'm a total b***h. I know I'm bipolar and can be selfish. He called me today and says he can't go through with the breakup. I was broken and didn't want a breakup to begin with, but I know I'm horrible at times and can't help it. It's like I'm battling myself. What do you feel?","Both options seem reasonable.  Seeking individual therapy will help you to cope with the mood changes that come with bipolar disorder, will give you a space to vent your negative thoughts, and will allow you to find the coping mechanism to address life and relational challenges.  IF your boyfriend is interested in attending couples therapy with you, it will assist in identifying the problems in the relationship that pushed him to the breakup and will give both of you the tools to communicate and resolve conflicts.I am a Licensed Professional Counselor in Texas, currently providing individual, couples, and family therapy services in West Houston.  You may reach me at 787-466-5478 to schedule an appointment.    ¿Debería buscar ayuda yo sola o junto con mi novio?Mi novio me dejo recientemente por ser mal hablada.  El piensa que soy una p***a.  Yo sé que soy bipolar y que puedo ser egoísta.  El me llamo hoy para decirme que no puede continuar separado.  Yo estaba destruida y no quería que nos dejáramos desde el inicio, pero se lo horrible que puedo ser a veces y que no lo puedo evitar.  Es como si estuviera en guerra conmigo misma.  ¿Qué piensas?Ambas opciones son razonables.   Buscar terapia individual te ayudara a manejar los cambios de estado de ánimo que son partes del desorden bipolar, también te dará espacio para ventilar los pensamientos negativos y encontrar herramientas para enfrentar problemas relacionales y de la vida diaria.   SI tu novio está interesado, también pueden asistir a terapia de pareja para poder identificar las razones de la separación, y obtener las herramientas apropiadas para  comunicarse apropiadamente y resolver conflictos.

I would suggest writing down a detailed summary of all the specific events as they relate to the breakup and what happened. It would be best if you were able to go through the story in detail, and then you could tell me the end result or the next step."
"My girlfriend's grandma passed away 5 months ago. They were very close. She took care of her till she died. Things kinda returned to normal few weeks later. Last month it feels like we hit a brick wall. Intimacy fell off. I asked what's up. She says she can't connect with anyone and that it's not me. She used to be very open and expressive. Now she gives short answers and has no interest in sex or any touching. When we did have sex in the last month, something felt really off. Now I'm very insecure about us and have thoughts of her cheating. She says otherwise, but I don't know. It just feels like something is really off.","Grief has a huge impact on us and everyone's reaction is different. The one common reaction however is to shut down and distance ourselves. Her relationship with her grandmother was close, given she took care of her up until she passed. It sounds like she is working through a difficult loss and her ability to connect with you, or anyone else, is likely low right now. Trust what she is telling you and try to be there for her as she works through it. If she finds it too difficult to connect again, a good grief counselor can help her get back on track.","First, a bit of self-awareness is helpful here. What exactly are your hopes for your relationship that feel unfulfilled? Do you have some kind of need for physical intimacy or emotional support from her? Having a couple of answers in mind helps you explore them with more insight. And, while your gut tells you she's the only one who can be intimate with you, it might also be helpful to think about your partner as a whole: would a new partner feel the same way about you? Your friend's girlfriend is a very reasonable person and she has every right to experience the same emotions. You don't have to figure out if or how you are both going to be intimate with each other. However, if you're feeling jealous or insecure about her relationship with her, then you have the chance to work on becoming more self-assured and in a better place than you think that you are. A person who is comfortable in their own skin is the best support for other people who are not as confident as you are."
"My son stole my debit card and lied about it. It's not the first time he has lied. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know if I should punish him or make him do something. I've tried talking to him and asking if anything was wrong. I have grounded him, but nothing works. What should I do?","Hi Enid, You sound like a sensitive parent; I like that you talked to your son to see if anything is wrong. There is some key information here (I don't know your son's age, whether he spent any money, whether he put the card back, or how many times he's stolen), and my answer might be different depending on those details, but I'll give you my thoughts.I see it as every child's job to figure out the rules and find where their power is in the world. In order to accomplish that, many of them test limits. ""What can I get away with?"" is a question they have to find the answer to. If a child knows the rules, they're much more likely to not test limits (because they already know the limits). So, part of testing limits is experimenting with stealing and lying. Not all kids steal, but I would say pretty much every child lies at some point. It's a normal behaviour, and most of the time it's about small things that don't matter and we don't even find out. Stealing a debit card is a bit more serious, and I'm not surprised he lied about it. If you absolutely know that he took it, it's okay to tell him that you believe he did this thing and also lied about it. It's appropriate to give a consequence for this type of behaviour, so that the child doesn't do it again. The consequence should be as natural and logical as possible. The behaviour (stealing) was harmful to you, so doing you a favour with extra chores might be a good idea. It's funny, because as parents we try to tell our kids that lying is bad, but they know they'll get a consequence if they tell the truth so there are natural deterrents to being honest (we don't want people to know our mistakes). It's a dilemma. If you really want to focus on the lying part, you can tell him that you won't give him a consequence for the lying if he decides to come clean with the truth within one day. That gives him incentive to come to you with truth. It sometimes works with kids to give them a chance to come clean and then reward them for telling the truth. You can set your child up for success and train them to tolerate honesty. Put a cookie on the counter. Tell your child to take the cookie at some point in the day. Then ask them later if they took the cookie. You're making honesty fun. Kids love games. Basically, there's as much power in rewarding the positive behaviour as punishing the negative. If this is the first serious offence for your son, don't make a big deal of it; consequence him and see if he learns. If it's a pattern, that's different and you may want the input of a therapist.","I've heard many people saying that children who lie to their parents are often telling the truth, and it's a mistake to be so upset with them for it. I don't have any information or thoughts about this. It has been my experience that parents don't worry for their children lying when it comes to the child stealing or doing something. However, as a child with very little education or experience, I am struggling to comprehend how this would be happening to me. The question I am trying to understand is why is my child doing this time, and if that is because of things I have taught him about lying or something else. I would also want to know how to talk to him about it in a way that he will understand.I hope your answer and advice are helpful."
"I am a teenage girl. I've been seeing the same dream once in a while since I was very young. The problem is that I don't remember anything about this dream. I still know that it's the same one, and then I wake up in a panic, and I cry really loud without knowing the reason. Why do I see the same dream, why can I not remember it, and what should I do to remember it?","There is no scientifically established formula for understanding dreams, that I know about, however, many people get a great deal of value from exploring what their dreams mean. It is believed by many that our dreams contain metaphors that represent meaningful patterns in our lives and relationships and if we pay attention to them we can learn important things about ourselves. One thing you might try, to see if you can get more insight into the dream and possibly begin remembering things, is to take note of whatever you do remember, any details about your experience, such as when do you wake up from the dream, how do you feel, both emotionally and physically, what are you thinking about when you wake up, is there any pattern in terms of what happens to you in your waking life around the time you have this dream... If you can keep a journal or a recording device to speak into by your bed, you can try to record whatever you do remember and notice as soon as you wake up. People seem to have more difficulty remembering dreams, the more time they let go by before attempting to record the dream, or if you go back to sleep before recording what you remember.","Hi,  I hope you are doing okay. I hear you and your feelings of sadness and worry are valid. When it comes to dreams, that is where it can be difficult to get help or clarification on what the dream means. Sometimes there are no good answers about them.  The more you try to remember or decipher the meanings of them, the more confused you can become.  It is possible there is no meaning, but more possible that you are just as confused as you are as you try to figure it out.  You might consider spending time in your local library or your local book store and see if there is anything about your dreams that you find out. Also, consider looking through a dream journal and writing down whatever you remember about each dream.  The more you focus and use your journal to record information about your dreams, the more you'll start to look for patterns and things that your brain remembers or suggests the meaning of the dream.  For a little help to focus and get a grasp on how your dreams fit with your own life, consider practicing mindfulness.  When you have moments of calm before falling asleep, pause and reflect on your dreams and the emotions you feel.  Ask yourself, ""What is my current life situation and what am I trying to achieve?""  And remember that the dream may be symbolic for your life or perhaps you are merely confused about the feelings you are dealing with at the time of the dream.    It can take time to help your brain make sense of dream symbols.  Also note that as you gain more experience with your dreams, you'll get better at remembering your dreams.   And since you only saw the same dream a couple of times, you may have been trying to find answers in the dreams.  In the meantime you can try to remember what happened. Try to remember all of the details.  What did you do? Who did you meet? Where did you go?  What were your feelings as you were in this dream?  Try to make a list of what you remember about the dream.  The more you remember, the better you will understand your dreams.  You might also consider consulting a dream expert.  The dream experts can help you figure out what they mean in relation to your life.  Do you have a dream expert that you"
I've recently thought that i could be transgender but I've never had the mind of a girl.,"Hello Frostproof,Thinking about becoming transgender and being transgender are slightly different.  This is a topic that is best discussed with a therapist that specializes in LGBTQ issues.  From what you have written it sounds as if you still have some confusion as to where you fit in with the ""labeling system"".  While labels provide a means to quickly identify and classify, they can also feel restrictive or confining.  Instead of focusing on fitting into a specific classification, explore who you are as a person and celebrate your positive qualities and those things that make you uniquely you!  There are many options for you to find a therapist and e-therapy is also an option.  You can try Breakthrough an online service.   Here is some reading for refection that you may find helpful.  Yin Yang Woman Man http://dld.bz/ejVK2  What does it mean to be a woman or a man?","It is difficult to say whether or not you can become transgender because you’ve never had the mind of a girl. You have a lifetime of experiences, which have been uniquely you. Having experienced life as a girl has given you a perspective that would have been impossible for you to have come to in another gender. You could still be transgender, if this was what you wanted. To say you're not transgender because you have never had the mindset of a girl may lead to feelings of regret or inadequacy and that may only serve to delay the person you need to learn more about. This is one reason why it's very important that someone who feels the need to become transgender may seek outside support from others who understand what they need to know."
"Because we are on opposite coasts, we try to talk early mornings, but she is constantly interrupted by visitors. I suggested setting aside some time, but she has made it very clear she has no intention of changing her lifestyle. She is also drinking beer every day on antipsychotics.","The answer depends on how satisfied and happy you feel in being part of this friendship.From what you write, there aren't any statements as to what gives you happiness about being a friend to this person.Since you already made a request of. your friend and she isn't following through, you could ask if she is willing to work with your suggested plan.The friendship may take a new format, depending on your friend's response.Its possible to be in contact more spontaneously, when either of you feel like contacting the other.What matters most is your own dissatisfaction with the current relationship status.Even if you change to a, birthday and holiday only conversation, or some other style of interacting, at least it will be the result of the effort from each person, not just one, who is you, designing arrangements which only you are willing to keep.",The time you are setting aside the time to do is not really time for you to do. You were planning to do something to help you. Maybe you need some help to find more self care time.
I suffer from checking and cleaning OCD. Can counseling help me to get over it?,"Counseling can be very effective for OCD. In particularly, a kind of therapy called Exposure Response (Ritual) Prevention Therapy is considered the 'gold standard' for the treatment of OCD. What this is, is a specific protocol that helps you build relaxation strategies and to increase the amount of time between your checking/cleaning rituals while also helping you to face any of the fears that OCD given you until those rituals and fears are no longer interfering with your life. Research has shown that this kind of therapy may even be more effective for OCD than medication, https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.162.1.151","I suggest looking at some research online. It might be useful to understand what is the difference between OCD and Anxiety. As an example, here are a few of the key differences:
1. OCD has the goal of relief and reduction, not of making a list of things to do. With anxiety, anxiety is like a ""hangover"" for the mind. Your anxiety is getting the thoughts back and the 'hangover' helps you to know the feelings better.
2. In the moment, you are going to be stuck in a cycle: you are ""caught"" by the feeling, then you are ""caught"" by the thought, then the thoughts become really uncomfortable, which makes you feel even more anxious.
3. In general, many people find that the only difference between OCD and Anxiety is anxiety. They just have different ways of dealing with it. In anxiety, the anxious person has a hard time getting things done. As such, they tend to have difficulty with all sorts of tasks such as organizing, planning or even being able to sleep. In OCD, a person has difficulty with just one thing. A person may worry about doing a task or putting things away and can get so overwhelmed and stuck in a cycle of worrying. In all cases, both anxiety and OCD can lead to the same symptoms. In short, this is not a hard decision to know.&#x20;"
"My brother has been a heroin addict for years, and he’s now in his mid-30s. He has taken from me my mom and my grandparents. He's sick in the head. Now he moved his girlfriend into the house because they both manipulated us. Today, my mom and my brother went toe-to-toe over his girlfriend not helping around the house and always being high. I ended up hitting my brother for getting so close to my mom's face. I feel terrible, but he's always picking his girlfriend over us. Mind you, he tells other girls that he hates his girlfriend, he's single, and she's only living here because he feels bad. We tried kicking them out and everything, but nothing is working. They do nothing to try and help.",I think the best thing for you is to speak with someone on how you can best cope with the situation.  It can be challenging living in a household with someone who is currently addicted.  It is also important that you realize that you can only work on yourself.  Other individuals need to take the same accountability.  Enabling often happens in households with addiction. It can be a challenging environment to live in.,"I think this question might be better addressed in a few different ways.  First, because in addiction therapy, what is important is to establish relationships as a baseline before you are ready for a relapse. If your brother was going to be truly successful, he would need to start building relationships with his mom and grandparents, because his addiction would need to be controlled by one person (you) rather than having multiple people trying to control him. It would be difficult to know how your mom and grandparents feel about him, and how well he would be able to respond if he were to be around them, and if it felt good for him. In addiction-relapse recovery, the main goal is to get back to the basics, and he has not done that. If he is determined to get back to sobriety, then he needs to begin with very clear and very firm, emotional boundaries. How are you going to have the same things happen again? Not one, but two. At least one, it must be a very clear, consistent, empathetic approach for his girlfriend. So maybe you could say something like ""I would feel better if your girlfriend would be willing to live in the house. I would also feel better if you could just be around her for an hour and come back to me, and if it doesn’t feel right to you then you have to leave and leave your girlfriend. Maybe that can be a good start for you.""  What does he find hard to do and is it something he wants to do, but not to go about doing and not to have a better relationship with his girlfriend?"
I keep on begging him to come back. I am so unhappy with him but am so scared of being a single parent to our son. I was abused as a little girl and that has made to be very abusive to men. What should I do...,"Major change frightens almost everybody.Don't be so afraid of your fear that you let yourself beg and are willing to accept unhappiness as a standard in your marriage.If you start considering that life can be better than what is current for you now, new possibilities and ideas will start developing in your mind.Consider finding a therapist so that you have private space to talk in detail about your fears and the new ways of seeing your Self.A therapy relationship, since it is safe and supportive, will be a good balance to having been abused, suffered, and unhappy.","I'm here for you, just by the same name."
"I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for a number of years. I have been on medication, but lately my depression has felt worse. Can counseling help?","Thank you for asking this important question. I find that there are three steps to getting ready for treatment. Step one is expressing interest in wanting to receiving treatment for the outcome of positive behavioral change. Congratulations you did the first step! You are showing your readiness to start counseling by asking this question. Now the second step is to find a counselor who specializes in treating clients with Anxiety and Depression. The therapeutic orientations I have found to be helpful in treating clients with  Anxiety and Depression are a combination of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with Mindfulness, and Solution Focused Brief Therapy. Receiving meditation for your symptoms if part of the treatment, and the other part is receiving counseling to increase your resilience for future events. Research has found that medication and psychotherapy treatments together shows the most effective outcome for Depression.  The third step is to increase your positive self-talk to motivate yourself to attend treatment. As counselors, we are aware of the anxieties and fears that are associated with talking to a new professional for the first time. However, remind yourself that you are doing this to improve your well being. I hope this was helpful, and good luck with your treatment journey.","Do you know what would be causing your depression more than previously? Do you know how long you have been working with your healthcare provider, and have they ever said that your depression is not helping? In addition, what has your physician told you if you have already started with counseling, whether or not it has been successful?  Most importantly, have you tried to seek out counseling? If your physician told you your depression is not helpful, then it is appropriate to search for a different provider. It can be frustrating to have a physical doctor tell you that your mental health is in a bad state, and is not in a good state. You need someone that will help you understand what’s causing your depression and help you find the solution."
I love my girlfriend so much. I get an erection even just thinking about her or seeing her. But the two times we tried to have sex I couldn't get an erection. We've only had sex once and it was a long time ago.    Why this is happening and what can I do about it?,"I want to be short and brief about this. First, If you can achieve a good erection at anytime without your girlfriend, your penis is fine. However, erections work through getting enough blood flow to the penis. If you are having any sort of mental related concern (anxiety, depression, stress, etc) it can cause your blood vessels to constrict and keep your penis from becoming erect. After reading your concerns, my questions would be: What are you thinking about right before and during sex?"" ""Do you feel anxious or nervous during that time?"" Have you ever experienced not getting an erection before?"" I am assuming it has do to with what you are thinking and their is a certain amount of anxiety you are having during or right before sex. If you want to work this out, I would encourage you to work on your thought process and learn to relax your mind and your body (meditation/relaxation exercises). Focus more on enjoying the experience through your 5 senses. What do you smell, take it in and enjoy it. What do you hear, take it in and enjoy it. What do you see, take it in and enjoy it. What do you feel, take it in and enjoy it. Calm yourself! Not having an erection is not the end of the world and happens all the time to men. If you freak out about it, it will happen more. Just relax, believe it is normal and try again and ENJOY the beauty in front of you!","Sexual arousal varies so much in each person and is influenced by many things and many different sources. It's good you think it's probably related to attraction and love/infatuation in your life, because it's very common when people who love are attracted to people they are having physical intimacy with. Your sexual experience might be associated with having some intense feelings about her which is usually a good thing. If you are experiencing a lot of intense lust, anxiety, or guilt at this point in time you would likely want to talk to a doctor. If not, that could mean some things related to your body that you need to consider, as well as some psychological factors that are at play."
Then turn right back around and say he loves me and needs me. This rollercoaster is crazy.,"Yes, I agree with your view about the ""rollercoaster"" sounding ""crazy""!Concentrate on knowing what your reasons are for staying with this guy, given the broad facts that you state.What are you gaining from being together and are these gains outweighing how you feel when your companion says the opposite of what he just told you?Also, examine yourself for any fears of being alone.Very often, people stay in detrimental relationships because of a fear that being alone will feel worse.It may, initially feel this way after a breakup.This is from change itself.Eventually, stability and peace of mind return, and being alone with oneself is preferred to being taken on an emotional rollercoaster by a partner.",What a terrible relationship! I have seen other partners who work a very similar relationship in this way. It seems to be based on both a lack of respect and the denial of one's feelings. I don't think this person is willing to consider things that could be changed. The fact that the other partner enjoys this is a sign of a bad relationship.
"A few years ago I was making love to my wife when for no known reason I lost my erection,    Now I'm In my early 30s and my problem has become more and more frequent. This is causing major problems for my ego and it's diminishing my self esteem. This has resulted in ongoing depression and tearing apart my marriage.    I am devastated and cannot find a cause for these issues. I am very attracted to my wife and want to express it in the bedroom like I used to.    What could be causing this, and what can I do about it?","If you haven't already, please see a doctor.  ED can be caused by any number of physical conditions and you need to get checked out.  Once you have ruled out any physical issues that interfere with getting an  erection, it's time to look for more subtle causes.  Unfortunately, you may have gotten yourself into a mind set of ""I hope I can, but what if I can't?""  which is certain to interfere with performance.Again, rule out physical causes (can you tell I think that's important?), then talk with your wife about working  together to find the right approach.  It might be a good idea, for example, to take the pressure off by enjoying each other without intercourse.  You can have great sex without penetration and you can have physical intimacy without sex, so slow down and experiment.  You might find more pleasure than you expect when you can relax knowing there doesn't have to be a ""finish line"".Again, yes the  third time, SEE A DOCTOR, just in case there's something going  on.  Once you get the all clear, find joy and spontaneity with your wife again by being creative and pressure free.","Hi. I hope you are doing well.  I don't believe that anything is happening in you.  The best approach for you is to focus on the feelings of sadness about what is happening and try to focus on other positive things for yourself, and your wife.  This may take a few times to see a difference.  When you focus on the positive you are more likely to enjoy the most things in your life! If you feel like you need help, don't hesitate to seek professional help.    Therapists are experts in helping people get to know themselves. It is best to come out of your discomfort of this problem and look for advice instead.   This will get you more help so you can eventually get the happiness and contentment you seek!"
"I find that I imagine things sexually, and I hate it because it puts strain on my relationship. I feel helpless and guilty. I want it to go away, and I want to make my woman happy again.","It is completely understandable that you would like to find a way to make these intrusive thoughts go away, however, your feeling that you can't control having these thoughts is accurate. It's also understandable that you would feel helpless and guilty, given that you see how these thoughts are effecting your relationship, though I would encourage you to go easy on yourself and remember that you aren't choosing to have these thoughts. I'm sure that if there was a switch to turn them off, you would flip it.There is no magic technique or pill that can guarantee these thoughts will go away, however, therapy may still have a lot to offer. In working with a competent therapist, you may be able to gain insight into where these thoughts are coming from and develop new ways of relating to them so that they do not leave you feeling as helpless and guilty and can be more present with your partner. Though there is no guarantee that the thoughts will go away, this may also be a result of work with a therapist. Either way, you may be able to find a way to deal with the thoughts and show up in your relationship in a way that will be satisfying to you and your partner.","My wife is not sexual when I'm in the same room. I was reading a study in the Journal of Sex Research and saw that sexual interest and intimacy are not necessarily the same as sexual desire. Sex desire can be based on a variety of factors and may be related to psychological state to her. My love for her is not based on sex desire. While I do not want my love to stop because I'm confused about what is going on in me, this does not mean I am in a bad place. It means that this is a relationship issue. It may involve a lack of attention from me or my concerns about my own sexual health, which may affect my desire for a relationship or how you express your desire. Talking with her about these issues may help clarify things, but is likely to involve a bit of work or a change of mind. In the meantime, I would start by making my girlfriend happy: take care of her needs.  Be attentive to her needs in the long-term."
"He is always telling me our fights are only and all my fault, he bashes me to our young child, and he is addicted to a few substances.","The behaviors you describe are boundary violations.  You can not change your spouse, but you can respond to his behaviors in ways that protect your boundaries and ensure your safety.  This is very hard to do without support.  Finding a therapist who understands the dynamics of abusive relationships may be helpful.  If you are not ready to do this, I recommend the book ""Boundaries"" by Dr. Henry Cloud and Dr. John Townsend.  It's a great resource for helping one recognize boundary violations and learning how to respond to them in ways that are constructive!",What type of substance does he use and how often does he use it to the point of addiction? What are the reasons why he is always saying his wife is always more than what he is and blames it for his success?
"She was raised by her abusive father and his wife. 30 years ago I shot and killed my rapist and was convicted in Louisiana. I lost custody of my daughter and served 5 years. When I was released, she was 5 and didn't remember me. Many many sad memories came from my having to leave her visit after visit, having to leave her in Texas to travel back to Louisiana. She doesn't remember that. I do. Over the years, I thought we had developed a close mother daughter relationship. She gave me good reason to doubt that on several occasions but especially last year. I have been cruel to her verbally and to my son who I met years after giving him up for adoption. Last night, I was angry at the world and afraid of God. I drank and cussed out a maintenance worker for not doing his job 4 months running. Now I'm not only feeling guilty for that but afraid of being evicted now. Help.","Was either parent abusive or violent toward you?You sound to have suffered emotionally in your relationships since early in life.One point to consider is to strive for moderation in what you offer in relationships.A lot of what you've lived through is extreme, either as victim or perpetrator.If you imagine that apologizing to the custodian for the way spoke to him, would calm him down, do so.At the very least, you'll be actively resolving your guilt over cussing at him, and fear of his retaliation.","I can only imagine what you've been dealing with in your life to have experienced these kinds of traumas. I am a little bit anxious as I have heard from many people that these kinds of things can have lasting effects on you. You've spent your life trying to protect your daughter and you’ve lost her in the process.  You are trying to protect someone you don't even know and that will change all your life. I wish you luck with the divorce and your daughter. It could be a very difficult relationship to grow up with. As you go through it, ask yourself, what is your own attitude about anger? What do you feel when people abuse you? How do you deal with the pain of your past? As you are healing, you need to focus on making sure you get the healing you need. So, for many people in your life, the most helpful thing to do when you've been through trauma is to keep in contact with those who love you and help them as much as you can.  As people who care about you, I believe that if we can help other people make a better life for themselves that may help us to live with ourselves better, and to create new memories."
"Her father and I have been dealing with this problem for quite some time now. She is an adolescent, and the problem is mostly food. She is now overweight, and we just don't know what to do anymore. She can be disrespectful and doesn't listen to or respect what we say.","I would be curious about there potentially being some emotional or physical trauma in your daughter's history that she is struggling with. Physical trauma is usually easier to identify, but emotional trauma can be feeling a lack of emotional connection in her important relationships, having experienced bullying, or some other emotional injury. The fact that there are some defiance symptoms going on suggests that she might be in need of a safe place to process what she's going through, and the potential issue with control or meeting emotional needs with food is also concerning. I would recommend looking for a therapist/counselor who works with children/adolescents in the area of addressing trauma for an assessment. They may be able to ask the right questions to see whether trauma is truly the issue.","There are 11 ways to reduce the weight.  The first ways to start with weight are to eat more fiber, which has many positive effects.  Food with very little calories is generally not advisable as it is not always the healthiest option.  As for the father, he is likely a man who may have learned from his father what is and isn't a healthy relationship.  When a young person is asking for his father’s help, there are many options for him.   You and she could seek a professional mediator for this relationship to see if they can find a mutually agreeable strategy that does not mean that you do not need a mediator.  A neutral party can help you and your father to find common ground and see if you can work through this issue.  A professional mediator can often help you and your father figure out what you want to do.   There are also various support groups and workshops available that are not bound by your financial health.  In general, people are more open to a dialogue that is not based on a hierarchy of power.    There also a lot of  mental health resources such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline which can be a helpful point of contact if the situation is not resolved or if a  professional is needed.   As for parents, the question of family boundaries is a huge point to consider.   Both parents must be willing to try and follow through in order for the situation to be effective.   There are several ways to set boundary that could lead to a better outcome for everyone involved, but there is no guarantee of success.   Good luck!"
"My boyfriend of five years told me he cheated on me during our relationship after we broke up. We've since gotten back together and are trying to make it work. I don't know how to trust him now, but I really want to make it work, and it seems like he does too. But my trust issues are getting in the way and causing problems.","Hi Michigan,This is a common issue. How do you trust after you know someone is capable of hurting you? I totally get that it's hard, and I believe it's worth it if you truly love and want to be with someone. You can be stronger in the scarred places. I would suggest that you each have a separate job to do to rebuild this trust. It is definitely possible to rebuild it, because anything is possible if both people want it enough.Your boyfriend came clean to you...this is pretty crucial. He chose to honour your needs rather than keep the secret. You can use that as evidence in your ""proof that he loves me"" file. Work on that file...thicken it up. Having a thick ""he does care about me and wouldn't hurt me again"" file will help you. Other things that he can do to help you thicken that file (because after all, his behaviours caused this problem): answer all your questions, don't brush you off if you're feeling insecure, treat you as though you're a priority, avoid questionable contact with other women, have open communication, give you passwords to devices so there is transparency. He can help you to understand where those behaviours came from...why he cheated in the first places (although people aren't always good with those 'why' questions!)You can focus on telling yourself that people change, that he deserves a chance to show you he can be loyal (or at least you've decided to give him that chance), and that you want to be a trusting person. If you act like a trusting person, you will likely feel more like one. Don't go snooping, don't interrogate him. It's normal you might feel scared and try to tell him that when you do. Let him know what happens that leads to you feeling scared.This is a start for you. A good therapist can be helpful too!",My name is Dr. Laura. I've had many women who needed my help with emotional wounds. It's not just about fixing the cheating. Cheating is damaging the foundation of trust between partners. You need to decide if you are willing to work your way through that. Your feelings are real. Maybe 5 years and he still does not want to change is a very good time to decide whether you really have the time to work through this in a relationship or not. I have heard from women who just decided on their own to end the relationship because of cheating. This is not a sign of weakness. It is a sign of women who know how to take care of themselves. This is an excellent quality to have as a person.  Take some time to think about what you really want.  This is not a big either way question. It's about finding what you're going to do with your life and what you value in each other.
I'm 17 and I'm sick and tired of going back and forth. I'd like to stay at my mother's house. This problem has really affected me. I've had anxiety attacks and suicidal thoughts and self-harm in the past.    Currently I'm going through anxiety and my thearapist is not available. How do I handle this?,"I am so sorry to hear you are going through this. Divorce can be so disruptive in a child's life.I'd really need a lot more information about your situation before I'd feel comfortable offering any advice or suggestions. There are so many variables, and not knowing the whole story, any advice could possibly make your situation worse.I do see some positives, though. One, you say you have a therapist. That's great! I hope you're able to talk to them about this soon. Still, they can't give you legal advice, and a lot of this situation may be dictated by the law. What your therapist can help with, though, is dealing with whatever situation you have to follow by law. If you can't change the situation, you at least need to learn how to cope with it better. Two, you're 17. When you're 18, you're legally an adult and will not be bound by any custody rules or visitation plans in place. Honestly, teenagers usually have a lot of say with the courts in custody arrangements. Since you didn't specify more on the situation, I have no idea what your specific situation is. Were your parents ever married? Are they separated or divorced? Was there ever a court hearing for custody? Not all couples have an official court order arrangement. All families are different, too. Was there abuse between your parents? Towards you by one of them? Does either of them have addiction issues, major health or mental health issues, or anything like that? You mentioned that you want to live with your mom, but didn't say why. Are you afraid to tell your dad you want to stay with your mom? Is mom the lenient and fun parent while dad is the more strict one, or is there something else going on? This isn't a decision that should be placed entirely on you, and it also isn't a decision that anyone else needs to make on your behalf without your input. But advice on what to do needs to come from the people who know more about your situation so they can help recommend the best thing for you. Whatever you do, hang in there! 18 will be here before you know it. Focus on that. Freedom. College. Plan for your future that YOU control, and focus on making it the best it can be. Do not let the anxiety and depression cloud your thoughts and make you do something irreversible.","Hi...I feel good to know your therapist is still available.It looks like you are struggling with this issue.We can talk about your thoughts, and how those thoughts affect your anxiety.It sounds like you have a lot on your mind here, so it will be good to talk with someone who can help you find a resolution to all of your fears.I hope you feel much better soon."
"A few nights ago I talked to this girl I know about my self esteem issues for the first time. We talked for hours and she told me time and again that I was a great guy. She told me I was attractive, and have a great personality, etc. I really started to feel better about myself by the time I woke up the next morning. Now, though, I can't stop thinking about her, but I leave to go back to college in a few days and I go to school 4 hours away from her. So now I feel constantly depressed because even if I told her how I felt it wouldn't matter. I feel helpless and I don't know what to do.","Hey!  It takes a lot of courage to share your feelings with someone!  And it sounds like you have been lucky to meet someone who makes you feel safe enough to explore some of your more painful feelings.  A big part of the process, however, of strengthening your self-concept is learning how to tell yourself those positive messages that you heard from your friend!  Leaving for college may also be contributing to your feelings of unsteadiness.  Try this - Make a list of all of the positive things that you know are true about yourself.  Ask your friends and family to contribute to the list.  Then carry it with you in your wallet - and when you need a self-esteem boost, take a look at it!  You are in a season of life that presents lots of challenges and opportunities.  Reach out to your long-distance friend when you need support - and take a walk over to the campus counseling center and check out what they might have to offer.  Be Wise!","First of all, know that you have the right to be upset about how she treats you and her comments.  You have the right to decide what is appropriate for you.  The fact that you value her is reassuring to you, and I want to acknowledge that.  But, if that is not enough and you still can't decide if she is a good person, or if you are better off without her, then that is up to you.  You can't change her, but you *can* control what you do with you life, and you can keep yourself safe from people that don't have your best interest at heart.  If that is not enough, try telling someone else about this, so maybe you will feel more supported when you're talking to her.  I am not telling you that you need to end the relationship with her, but I would not want her to tell others about you, because it would hurt you in the long run.  You can just tell her one more time about how you feel and tell her that you will take more time to consider her feelings, if you decide to talk to her in person."
"I suffer from adult ADHD, anxiety disorder, and depression. It has been difficult to find a doctor in my area and my primary physician won't help. I am unemployed and overwhelmed. What would you suggest I do?","I would check out agencies that offer affordable counseling based on your income or very low cost counseling sessions, i.e., Pacific Clinics, Hathaway Sycamore, Pasadena Mental Health Center, Burbank Family Center. If you google affordable or low cost therapy in your particular area you will find resources to help you.","Hi there,  I can see why you would feel that way as you can see many of your own symptoms being mirrored by those that have a diagnosis of Adult ADHD. I hope your primary doctor or the mental health professional you were seeing is happy to help you in any way. Here are a few more suggestions that you can consider to help with your situation:

1.  Take a look at the symptoms you are experiencing in the context of adult ADHD. These symptoms are often similar to the symptoms that someone with ADHD, and depression, and anxiety. If your ADHD is not diagnosed in adult ADHD, then it is helpful to look at those symptoms again. You may find that many of those same symptoms happen to yourself, too.  What's more important in this instance is to know you are not alone in this, as is the experience of many adults with ADHD in my own years, working with me, working with some of my friends and many other adults.  I have friends who have worked with ADHD in adult ADHD and feel very successful, and I am happy to say that is true for them too.  You probably can find it too.  In addition to medication to help ADHD, which will be prescribed by the doctor, are exercise and diet. As for symptoms of depression and anxiety, are you able to speak about them to someone who will listen to you? If not, consider a therapist or counselor. Some people may find that counseling in  a group setting, like a CBT class can assist with your mental health."
"My boyfriend lost his dad to suicide. He says that because his dad died, so did his heart. He says that he can't be there for me or love me anymore and wants nothing to do with me ever again. Why is he doing this when we were very happy together? He says that I have done nothing wrong but he just can't be with me.","I am sorry to learn of this.  You must be extremely frustrated and heartbroken.  To begin, he is correct.  You have done nothing wrong.  This is entirely a coping mechanism in overdrive.  It is fear.  It is anger.  It is extreme sadness.  It is feelings of abandonment.  It is intense emotional pain.  It is his way of protecting himself from potential unexpected additional loss.I am not familiar with how old this post is, but often, it will require time and understanding.  If he speaks with you, encourage him to get grief counseling.  Do not encourage it for your relationship, encourage it for his betterment coping with losing his dad.  Start there.  Good Luck.","If your boyfriend left you because he blames you for a tragedy he didn’t cause, then it may be time for him to give you his full attention as it seems he cannot handle this situation as you are also in the process of grief and possibly very angry at him. Take a deep breath and ask if he feels guilty? If so, be sure to talk to him about what he thinks he's doing wrong. Also, don't try to change him. When you are happy as a couple again then he will be happy for you too."
I haven't uttered one word to my boyfriend in days. Now I'm over it and don't know how to approach the situation?,"In any relationship, it is important to be able to say ""I'm sorry"" because it shows vulnerability and openness. I recommend that you sit and have a discussion with him now that you are calm about why you were upset and how you would like to handle such incidents in the future. If you find yourself becoming upset again, I encourage you to take a 20 minute break and then come back to the conversation once you are no longer heated. Studies show that talking or discussing arguments are more effective once you have cooled down and you are more likely to hear/understand what your partner is trying to convey.","First, take some time to read and reflect on your feelings from the last few days, weeks or months. Sometimes our feelings reflect our real needs, and sometimes a little bit of guilt or self-doubt. What was you're feeling at that time that you didn't have a partner to talk to?"
"My boyfriend and I have not had sex in a couple of weeks. He had to have a cyst removed on his testicles. I have been wanting to have sex with him for a while now, and it drives me crazy not to be able to make love to him. I'm scared to touch him and get close to him because I'm afraid that I will hurt him.","Are you talking with your boyfriend about his doctor advises on starting to have sex again?Being able to talk together about topics that involve both of you, will establish a new type of intimacy on an emotional level.Also, there are many ways of making love.  If your bf's cyst hasn't yet healed, then another way of both increasing your emotional intimacy and learning different love making suggestions, is to read about these together with him.I hope the two of you enjoy learning new ways of sexually taking care of one another, while developing more emotional closeness in the process.","I appreciate that you are curious about your sexual feelings and you are so concerned about what it would mean if you were to make love with your boyfriend. Since you have a real fear about hurting him, it would be wise to explore that. However, it may be helpful to talk to your boyfriend about how you feel and that you are not sure what you want in this matter. Be sure that you discuss how you feel with him and if he wants to talk about this with you. Be clear about your expectations and your desires. Be willing to listen as well. You could even suggest talking to a counselor who specializes in sexual issues."
"I don't have time to live or take care of myself at times. It's causing depression, stress, and anxiety. I don't know what to do.",I'm not sure whether you are referring to having a lot of activities after school or that homework is overwhelming. Can you set aside a couple hours a week for yourself as a place to start?,"The most immediate thing to do is acknowledge this concern, and listen to yourself. I encourage you to see and listen to yourself with kindness and care. Then, start to examine how the stress and anxiety you're experiencing is affecting you, what you're getting from it, and what you’re hoping to get out of the situation and change things. How will you feel in 6 months and 1 year? Would you like to be in this moment and now?   How many times do you want to change things? Knowing the answer is the first step in making things better."
"Every once and a while, I think about my ex-boyfriend from four years ago, and my current friend. It’s like I can't get past it, and I need some kind of closure. I keep thinking about how we had something, but it got cut off due to parental intervention. Nothing was ever wrong with it. Now we've become friends, but there's this huge sexual tension between us, or at least I feel it when we're physically in the same place.
   Two summers ago, we saw each other casually for a while, but we never had sex then or while we were dating, which was only for two months three years ago. I'm now in my 20s, and my current boyfriend is amazing and in his 30s. Despite the age difference, I know we're a really good match. We've never really fought and are able to make compromises and talk everything out. I tell him everything. Also, my ex-boyfriend has a girlfriend now as well. He’s been seeing her on and off for the past two and a half years, besides when they broke up and we had our casual thing. That summer, I told him I didn't want anything serious and broke it off. Only a week later, he had gotten back together with his girlfriend. His girlfriend is kind of mean spirited. I'm sure she may be different around him, but I worry about him committing to her in the long run. They're supposed to move in together soon. But still, I feel this connection with my ex-boyfriend, and I feel like he does too.    I don't know what to do. I need some closure or I'm not going to be able to move on from this. I don't know what it is, but it's driving me crazy. I’m so happy with my current boyfriend, and I know he will do everything in his power to make my life beautiful and fulfilling. He’s such a good person. I also know my ex-boyfriend smokes marijuana and does other things, but I can't get it out of my head. I'm trying to take a nap right now between classes, but I can't sleep because my mind is racing. I've never been so hung up on something for this long ever.
   I want to just talk it out with my ex-boyfriend, but I don't know if that's a good idea because of the possibility that it could blow up in my face. If he told his girlfriend, everything could go wrong because she hates me. If my current boyfriend knew, he would be crushed. On one hand, I want my ex-boyfriend to say no to having feelings for me, but I would be terrified of what to do if he said he has feelings too. Where would I go from there? On the other hand, I feel like I can't move forward in my relationship with my current boyfriend without closure from this. Sometimes I wish I could just cut off everything that had to do with my ex, but I don't want to.
   Please help me, because I really have no idea what to do.","If you're in a relationship and you're having strong thoughts about someone else, it's important to pay attention to that. Although you say you're happy, I'd suggest looking really carefully at the relationship you have and whether you're getting everything you need. Is there a physical connection with your ex that you don't have with your current boyfriend? It could be that your boyfriend is marvelous in many areas, but that you just don't feel excited about him for some reason. That's a pretty important element to be missing.It may be that, even if you are happy with your current boyfriend, you still hold something special for your ex. If you feel the need to see what is possible there, I think you have to tell your boyfriend about that and end it with him first. You can't have everything.If you truly feel that you want to be with your current boyfriend, you will do well to stop thinking about and focusing on your ex, because thoughts of him will interfere with the growth of your current relationship. The grass isn't greener... A therapist can help you to focus your energies and thoughts on the present, rather than an imagined version of the past or future.","You may have to think about whether you want to pursue a relationship with your ex-boyfriend or a new relationship with your current boyfriend. If you like both of your relationships, you'll probably want to be happy with both or at least one of them. I think your current boyfriend is a great fit for you, and that's the best thing for you. At the same time, it's important for you to remember what the other person you want a relationship with would like, but don't be selfish by letting them influence your decisions. If you are going to want a certain outcome, there are a number of ways to go about it. You could write up an out-of-office letter to give your ex the sense that you're not looking for something new and that his interest does not need to be returned. If that doesn't work, and you're truly wanting to be in a relationship with him, or with a friend, you may want to talk with him and offer him the same opportunity to have a chance to be in a relationship with you. Otherwise, let go of the hope, and he will be happy. 
I hope this gives you some clarity."
"I keep feeling paralyzed and unsure during interviews. Previous jobs have fired me for lack of performance, and five employers have rejected me after extensive personality tests and interviews. I'm afraid of continuing because my depression is getting worse. I'm already humiliated working for temp agencies and doubt my self-worth as a provider for my family.","It sounds like you are feeling pretty overwhelmed and stuck between wanting to improve your work situation and worrying that you won't be able to. It is possible that the paralysis, uncertainty, and self-doubt that you describe are contributing to your difficulty in getting  and maintaining a satisfying job as employers generally like to see that a potential employee is confident and can think on his or her feet. With a competent therapist, you may be able to get more understanding of the roots of these feelings and learn how to move forward in your search for a better work life in a way that leaves you feeling confident and capable.","I can understand how you feel! A very bad reaction to rejection can often lead into a spiral! But if you want to start to overcome some of these feelings, there are techniques that can help. There are exercises you can do with a friend. Your goal is not to stop applying for jobs, but to use your time and energy to improve yourself.  Sometimes, the feeling of being paralyzed is a sign that you're simply too busy to be productive and would be much better at finding a job that is something you are great at. If you start moving around a little bit you will start to feel more self-assured and therefore you'll begin to get better at interviewing! What would you like to give a job opportunity to?"
"I feel so alone. I have so many people around me, but it seems as they just listen and dont understand. They say it will all be okay, or they don't listen to me st all. Everyone says they are here for me but it doesn't feel like they are. Why do I feel so alone?","We feel alone because we are not comfortable with being our self. When you find that nobody is around do you feel alone? Your never alone. Once you take the journey to really understand who you are and unconditionally loving all that is you, there will never be an alone moment. We seek outside of self to fill inside. This is the big lie of the planet. All you need and have ever needed you supply yourself. www.lifecounselingorlando.com","You feel alone because of feeling like you are not hearing what's said. How does the world feel to you at times? What are you doing, thinking, doing, feeling? Not all your world and in all your actions are connected to any person that you would consider a friend. Do you feel safe in your space? Or do you not feel safe?  Do you fear that someone could hurt you, or get angry at you and leave you alone? If you feel afraid of being hurt or left alone, then you may feel that you do not have a place for anyone to be who can support you."
"I'm depressed often, and my mind goes a million miles a minute. Every once in a while, things are okay for a few days. After a bit, I start noticing that I am picking at my skin profusely. After roughly a week, the anxiety is back and still picking. Sometimes I find myself causing fights to have change.","Hello, and thank you for your question. I am very sorry that you are struggling. I have a few thoughts and perhaps some of my colleagues will add something else. Depression and anxiety can both be chronic conditions, as you have experienced. This means that they may always require treatment in order to have some kind of relief from them. Treatment could mean medication or some kind of counseling. Some people may take medication for the rest of their lives. Some people may go to counseling at times when the depression and anxiety worsens. As you mentioned, sometimes the symptoms improve for a little while, but they can also come back. When they do, it is important to talk to your medical provider if you are getting medication, and/or to go back to your counselor and talk to them about the symptoms that have returned. Skin picking and some other behaviors are not uncommon for people who are experiencing something like anxiety. Many people report that they do this when they feel anxious, and some say it calms them down. It is not really a surprise that you are constantly trying to change things and even starting fights to do so. These are ways to try to avoid, escape and distract yourself from the feelings of anxiety and depression. That is a very normal thing to do. Nobody likes these feelings, and so distraction is something we naturally try in order to get rid of them. The problem is that things like distraction and escape do not work as a long-term solution. In fact, they usually make things worse for many different reasons. Depression and anxiety can  be treated, but it is likely something you will need some help with. I would recommend finding a counselor who has experience with anxiety and depression. Medication can be helpful, but I still recommend counseling. The reason for this is that the medication can help with symptoms, while the counseling can address the symptoms and provide you with very helpful skills. Be well,Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPCC, NCC","This sounds like you are on the edge of a serious depressive episode. The fact that you described that after a period of time your mind goes a million miles a minute is a common symptom of depression, and the fact that you mention your skin itching or picking up on a week ago suggests that you may have a mild depression. Also, that you mentioned fighting to have change suggests that you might be experiencing a mild form of depression, which is an unhealthy way to cope with emotional distress.The fact you mention causing fights suggests that the depression may be affecting you personally.This can be the case if the depression is not getting much better.Sometimes this is called ""Depression-Related Physical Symptoms"".If you have a history of depression, you may have been diagnosed with a depressive disorder by a medical professional.If you have not been seen by a medical professional, you should consider seeing one for depression.The symptoms you experienced are the symptoms of a clinical depression diagnosis. Depression is the most common mental illness.If you are in depression, there are many places you could get help.You could talk to your doctor, look for counseling centers or mental health services in your area, or call a crisis hotline.Here are some great resources:https://www.mentalhealth.gov/https://www.depression.org/"
I have three children. The oldest is nine and not my biological child. The middle child is three and the youngest is one. I have a great relationship with the oldest two children but I haven't developed the same level of attatchment to the youngest child. I rarely want her around and look forward to her nap times. Is this normal?,"This is your experience, your feeling and you are wondering if it is normal, which means is this common or the rule. This question about how you feel about your third child leads me to believe you are dis- turbed [etymology: agitated or stirred up].  Feelings are messages from our soul or spirit that something is not right.  So, though  it might be normal [common, the rule]  to look forward to a one year olds nap time when you have a three year old a nine year old, the dis- turbance or stirring up in you, is important and requires your attention, your listening, if you will to your higher self.","As for whether this is normal, I feel it is common to never develop a very deep attachment with a child of the same sex. Many parents of young children struggle with this feeling at times. It may be that you are not comfortable getting close to your youngest child.  This might be a number of reasons.  First, first kids who are born into a family with different children's sex might not want or be comfortable with getting too close.  Often, there is a difference in feelings about sexuality that may affect closeness and whether or not to take the time for a conversation about feelings.  Then, there is the question of whether or not you are comfortable with being the mother to someone who doesn't fit into the traditional picture.  In other words, if you feel more connected to the oldest children than you do to the youngest, I think that's normal. However, a mother should know whether her child is comfortable with the parent-child relationship.  Most parents want their children to have a close bond with them to help them to grow into well-rounded, happy adults.  If this has been a long time since the start of childhood, it is certainly possible that your child's feelings of not being too close are the reason why.  Don't wait to talk to your child about her feelings.  Often children of this age are happy to express their feelings and want to be connected. In other words, you could start with a simple conversation about having a time to see and talk about her feelings as a child. As for how you feel about it, you know what you are comfortable with!"
"The eight months I've been dating my boyfriend, I have lied about a lot of things. I slept with a couple guys to get back at my boyfriend for breaking up with me. Now anything I say to him he won't believe, even if I'm being honest. I don't know what else to do at this point. He constantly criticizes me.","Start a conversation with him about your sincere interest to earn back his trust.Ask him what he expects from you so that he will trust you again.If you are consciously willing and do try to earn back his trust, and have periodic conversations with him on whether he feels more at ease with trusting you, then after a few months of this, both of you should feel more secure in the relationship.","Wow, I'm very sorry to hear that you were hurt. I imagine it's really difficult and painful when someone you care about breaks your trust and then is unable to work through those faults.  I'd be interested to hear more about the relationship you two have been in. What are your other relationships like?Are there other people that you talk about like friends and family?Are you able to have other relationships that don't feel the same way?What is your history with what it looks like to trust someone? Do you have a history of intimacy that you feel uncomfortable with?I understand this is a tough moment to be in, but the most important thing you can do is start to explore your values and what is important to you in other areas of your life. This has nothing to do with your boyfriend (as long as he makes you feel safe and respected) and has everything to do with where you want to be in the long term."
"I terminated my counseling relationship with a social worker several years ago. I am now realizing that I would like to begin counseling again. The social worker’s voicemail message says that he returns calls in 24 hours, but he hasn't called me back. I called him on the weekend and made it clear that I want him to call me back. Can he just ignore me?","Mental health providers should promptly return calls from current clients as well as from potential clients.  This is even true if the social worker (or counselor) is unable to make an appointment with the caller.  In that case the social worker should call you back to let you know that he is unable to schedule an appointment with you.In addition, mental health providers have an obligation to follow through with their own communication standards.  For example, if the social worker in this case has an outgoing voicemail message that promises returned calls within 24 hours, he has an obligation to follow through on that promise.All that being said, it is also worth remembering that mental health professionals are just people too. It is possible that he had an unforeseen emergency that kept him from from returning your call promptly.In the end, I agree with Sherry's advice. If you feel this social worker is not a good fit for you, you probably should trust your gut and find someone else who is a better fit.","A 24-hour wait time to get a call back for a client is quite a long time in our culture. It's reasonable that this would be a frustration, but I do not think that is the only possible explanation as to why he has not responded. Perhaps you can try sending him a polite, friendly email or letter. Many people enjoy getting a thank you note and feel happy when it happens. Don't be surprised if he doesn't respond but at least you'll know you have a good relationship with him."
"My mother has Alzheimer's and I can see that she has lost some of her intellectual abilities. Even though I know this disease is not her fault, I’m still finding it difficult to separate my own feelings of disappointment and frustration when my mom seems to ignore my opinions and wishes, and seems","Good observation on your part, to distinguish that your feelings in relation to your mom are not necessarily connected to the way she handles her part of the relation toward you.Has your mom usually ignored your opinions and wishes in relating to you?If prior to the onset of Alzheimer's, she never examined her way of relating to you, and if both of you have never had an open conversation about your sense of feeling hurt by her attitudes and manner with you, then the relationship between you and your mom will change in ways other than rational dialogue.She may continue ignoring or overlooking your wishes because she's been stuck in this attitude for most of your life.The good news for you about this is realizing that who you are and your way of relating to your mom, has very little to do with the way she relates to you.This is a more profound disappointment because it shows that her disconnect from you has been for longer than when the Alzheimer's began.You can however, feel a little more free knowing that you're not deserving of being ignored.","I am so sorry you are struggling with this. There will definitely come times you will have trouble separating your own feelings with your Mother's (Alzheimer's), so be sure to give your own Mother a chance to speak and hear you.  Even though your Mom knows you better, she doesn't always respond in the way you desire.  When your Mother doesn't respond in the way you desire, it is important that you acknowledge your own feelings while also expressing them in an important and healthy way.  This can also include things like having some ""un-talked-about"" conversations with your Mother.  She may learn something new you want to share or learn from her Mother.  This is a positive and could help to build more understanding between your two families.     If you find this difficult to handle, then you could also talk with a therapist about it."
"I don't feel like myself anymore. For example, I could walk up an entire flight of stairs before realizing that my legs are moving. I feel like I’m watching my life be lived by someone else.","You may be experiencing a form of dissociation called depersonalization.  People with this type of dissociation may feel disconnected from their bodies, feel that they are watching their bodies from a distance, or may not recognize their image in the mirror.  Dissociation sometimes occurs after someone experiences something traumatic.  I would suggest working with a therapist who specializes in dissociative disorders as dissociation does not typically resolve on its own.  On my website, I have some information specific to dissociation that you may find helpful.  Best of luck to you.","I know exactly what you mean. It is odd to take on roles or take on responsibilities that you don't like, whether that's taking care of a parent's elderly parent or carrying on the family business. I also have the feeling of an older brother or sister with my parents. It feels as though I'm not living my life as I please. The question is: what would it look like for me to really get back to where I am and feel good about who I am, but how do I know that?"
The past always feels much brighter and more beautiful than my present. Everything about what's gone feels so amazing; almost like I'm high off nostalgia. But in the end it just makes me feel sadder knowing that all of the memories (and a close friend that left me) are gone forever. How do I move past that and live more in the present?,Do some self-reflecting as to what areas of your life you'd currently like to develop.The good news is you know how happiness feels.That you were able to create situations and dynamics which produced happiness in your life is good motivation to believe happiness is possible and to try new ways to create this in your life.,"You are a bit lost in time thinking about it and making things feel 'too good' that never end. What's truly going on when it is that you find it easier to look back at good times than you can look into the future?  Sometimes, life gives us many lovely memories to look back at as part of enjoying life. But what happens when you try to look to the future and it seems overwhelming? It is usually the past that leads us into a spiral of sadness. Often it is all the good times that make us feel happy because it's so nice to think about what would happen if everything went differently. But how about what's happening right now? When we try to focus on what's going to happen, we might get to much focus from the past instead of the present. I would say this is the most important time to focus on our present and not worry about future plans or past mistakes. That way we can learn from our past and feel good about the present.  Sometimes if we are feeling too sad about the past, we can focus on the way that we have handled situations in the past and how those situations are affecting us in the present day. If we have been bad at things in the past, we can acknowledge that and work towards making better decisions in the future. This could also be helpful if we have been good at things in the past, but we have struggled with making sure that we do good at the present time.  It is important to know that in general, life is not always easy and that we will experience hardship and disappointments along the way. But in all of those times, there are also times of joy and love, the same things that we are looking for as we try to get through hard times. If we believe that the way of life is a series of moments with highs and lows, then life is what it is. We must just decide whether or not we want to focus on the highs or lows and try to find a way to find joy and happiness in life."
"Every time I send a message to someone or a group message on Instagram, iMessage, or snapchat people will read my messages but then they won't answer me.    Could it be that there is something they don't like about me? I don't understand why they won't answer my messages. How do I get people to respond to me?","I'm sorry that you are having a difficult time.I wonder about how your friendships are in person. If you get along well with people and have effective conversations with them face-to-face, there could be some kind of technology-related problem.Have you tried gently talking to people about how you send a message and they didn't answer? If you can phrase it in such a way that they recognize that you are asking for information and not blaming them for not answering you, that could be effective.I'd also encourage you to consider how much this is bothering you. If it is causing a significant amount of anxiety (say, more than 5/10 if 10 is really anxious), I would suggest talking with a local therapist.In the meantime, consider talking about this with someone you trust to whom you can get more details to get a more specific answer.","As a large language model, I don't have personal experiences of being able to respond to message. I do however know about common reasons why people are not responding to messages. Many of the most common reasons are because they do not know you well, are not interested in having a conversation or don't appreciate the amount of effort that I invest in helping them by helping them reach out to me.  I'm not a person, I don't have the ability to respond to them back in the same way or on the same time frame as a real person. I have to wait for the message in the first place. Therefore, if you need to get through to people and get your message to people who are likely not to respond to your messages you'll need to consider which is the right amount of effort for you to put into this request. If the message is from someone you care about, and you know the person is likely to respond, then go ahead and send them a message and reply to them promptly if they respond. If it's from someone you don't know well, it may be worth sending a more thoughtful and interesting message and waiting a bit longer to see if a response comes in. I hope this helps!"
"I'm in college currently, so I am not a direct victim anymore. My father is very abusive with his words and actions, and my siblings are getting treated horribly.","Yes you can help!  Emotional and verbal abuse can cause a negative impact in your family.  It is important that you encourage your siblings to seek assistance with a therapist, and maybe help them find one, they should have school counselors available and if not our college counselor may help you to get referrals.  It’s also a good idea to talk to your mom about the issue and ask her if she would like help as well.  If you are concerned about your siblings' safety, contact Family Protective Services in your state, they will investigate and refer your father to classes or therapy as needed. It takes courage to do the right thing, you can do this!¿Hay algo que pueda hacer para ayudar a mis hermanos a escapar de nuestro emocionalmente abusivo padre?Actualmente estoy en la universidad, así que no soy victima directamente.  Mi padre es muy abusivo con sus palabras y acciones, y trata a mis hermanos horriblemente.¡Tu si puedes ayudar!  El abuso emocional y verbal puede causar daños graves en la familia.  Es importante que motives a tus hermanos a visitar e incluso encontrar a un terapista, la escuela debe tener uno disponible, y también puedes pedirle referidos a tu Consejero universitario.  También es buena idea que hables con tu mama al respecto y le preguntes si a ella le gustaría buscar ayuda.  Si te preocupa la seguridad de tus hermanos, contacta a el Departamento de Protección a la Familia en tu estado para reportar el abuso.  Ellos investigaran y determinaran si el hogar es un ambiente seguro par tus hermanos y recomendaran terapia o clases para tu papa.  Hay que ser valiente para hacer lo correcto, ¡tú puedes hacerlo!","It seems that it would be wise for you to seek support for this, since it's a very complicated family of relationships. You may even wish to seek a parent with whom your father is familiar with you as well. I suggest for each you to take some time to work on yourself, even if it's just for 30 minutes a day. You will need to learn how to set boundaries in order to cope with the family and friends who are behaving in a manner in which you have not seen in a long time. I hope that your mother and your siblings can help you in this endeavor, however there are some family issues in place that may affect you both. It may also be helpful to know about your parents' wishes for your future in order to know if you'd like to get married or raise a family."
"I've been depressed for quite a while. I've been trying to work through it, and my boyfriend has been my rock. He is honestly the only person I trust enough to talk to about anything, but he decided to break up with me because of my depression. I cannot afford to see a therapist or anything, so he saw no hope in staying with me. My insurance has a $5000 deductible, so I’m screwed. I've had everything from suicidal thoughts to trying to quit my job. I have no one. My family doesn't care about me; they kicked me out when I turned 18 a few years ago. I had friends, but they have all moved on with their lives and have no time for me. My ex-boyfriend is trying to help but is making things worse because every time I see or hear him, I break down into tears. I found out that I will never be promoted now because of my depression.","It sounds like you have been struggling with this for quite some time, using many of the same coping techniques that feel tried and true to no avail. Often, we fall back on coping techniques that would be helpful in other problems (stress, social anxieties, etc.) for our depression, but the truth is that depression requires it's own little tool kit. Depression is all-encompassing, and, based on what you've written, the symptoms are already affecting work and your personal life in myriad ways.  The best route forward would be to seek out counselling, admittedly, but if your insurance deductible is too high, that can be very expensive. I would recommend contacting your Employee Assistance Program (EAP) if offered by your employer. If not, you can look into community centres for counselling options, check if your doctor will give you a referral or your local religious organization. If, however, you are motivated to get your depression under control, there are some great workbooks out there that you can use on your own or with your therapist (as long as your therapist is trained in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, or CBT), such as ""Mind Over Mood"".","Hi, thank you for your response! I really appreciate you including your thoughts in my response. I think you have a point when you said that ""You would have to look for some more emotional support from a friend or family member"" since you have tried it all. I think a therapist may have an understanding for you, and help you get through some of the barriers you are facing. You can't solve this by yourself. Your ex will probably only get what he wants. It’s a shame and there's nothing wrong with wanting him to just leave you so you can be happy. You just have to know that your ex is not going to go anywhere with you, he may even be feeling some guilt. The idea that you'll get stuck with his anger and negativity won't do you any good. The best way to deal with an anger-throwing or constantly negative guy is for you to walk away from him.  The most important thing is to take care of yourself.  Your boyfriend may be doing what he thinks is best for you, if he thinks you need a break or some time off. But you're really not a 'good' or 'reliable' person for your own sake.You are very fragile and you may not have enough of your emotional energy to do much at all in your own life. And the best way to live a good life is to do what you can to take care of yourself and focus on helping yourself. You are not a good girlfriend and/or daughter. Your family is part of the issue.You are not stuck in a relationship that will end up hurting you.In fact, relationships can be great and beneficial! Maybe you would be interested in checking out some dating apps or other ways to socialize and meet some new people. You know, you have more than enough people in the world to meet people.It will be okay.&#x20; Take care, dear friend! :)"
"She treats me like I'm not in her presence. She’s always yelling at me for no reason. She gives more respect to my brothers than me, but only my brothers fight her while I respect her.","Attention is not equal to love and being valued. It may be precisely because your brothers demand so much more your mom's attention through fighting with her that she pays more attention to them. It is a common situation in families where the ""squeaky wheel gets the grease"" and the siblings or family members who don't demand as much attention end up feeling invisible. It sucks to feel invisible and it is important that there is attention for you and that you know how much your mom loves and values you.  This sounds like an important conversation to have with your mom and if she is not able to really understand or help you address this concern you may want to suggest doing some family therapy where a skilled therapist can help you and your family work this out.","The feelings that you are expressing are quite common and it would be great to know that you are one of the few people who see you and feel such a deep level of anger and discomfort.  It's important to note that anger is often associated with feelings of fear, and it is a legitimate defense mechanism.  The fact that this is causing you distress and not feeling comfortable is more important than the issue at hand.  If this is how you feel more comfortable in her presence than how you feel in your own presence, then there is something you can do to see this in a different light.  Maybe you can see if she has any other anger issues with men or other people, or if there is something about how she treats other people that may be causing you such frustration?  If you decide to explore this in that light, then look for signs of anger in her and look for any moments where your anger may shift into that direction.   This will allow you to see what is driving your rage, rather than just the rage itself.   Sometimes it is good to talk to another person in the house about your feelings.    You could say to your sister that you are frustrated by this and that you want to get her to understand that you feel this way.   This might not go as well as you would like, but you'd be surprised how often people do not get the message.   If you can't talk to this person then you could find an outside therapist that can help you to communicate and work through these issues.   Ultimately you are the only one that can feel what the other person may or may not feel.   You are not obligated to see them for what is wrong to them, but you are always obligated to see them for what you feel, even if they don't feel it, or can't see it.   Because that is what you really need to do.    This is about understanding yourself better.   And in general, this is what I want to help people get over their anger.   If you aren't successful in this, then the real problem is the anger itself.   Your first step should be self-care and to try to work with your anger in"
"I’ve been on 0.5 mg of Xanax twice a day for the past month. It hasn't been helping me at all, but when I take 1 mg during a big anxiety attack, it calms me down. I was wondering how I can ask my psychologist to up the dose to 1 mg twice a day without her thinking I'm abusing them. I just have very big anxiety attacks. Should I stay on the 0.5mg and deal with the attacks or should I ask to up the dose? I'm afraid she will take me off them and put me on something else.","It seems like what you are looking for is a way to advocate for yourself and that's so important in mental health! You know best what is working for you and what isn't, so you are the best person to speak out for yourself to the people that can help you. I have extensive training in substance abuse and medications used in therapy, and I work with many people that take Xanax.  Counselors may not prescribe, but with the right training we can educate and help you move through the complexities of medication usage when paired with therapy. There's definitely some debate about using medication in the counseling world, but many people are prescribed Xanax to cope with big emotional responses.  We don't know much about your situation here--if you are in counseling, what types of other coping skills you've tried to use, etc., so it'd be hard to suggest not taking anything for your symptoms.  You are obviously struggling and sometimes stabilization is the best you can do.  And the fact that you are considering dealing with the attacks as an option is a sign you are willing to negotiate your dosage and maybe even the intense fear you are experiencing.  That's seriously so courageous.A little bit about Xanax--Xanax is a drug in the Benzodiazepine family and is fast-acting.  That means it does only help short-term, but your body also builds a tolerance to it pretty quickly (just as people build tolerance to alcohol).  That could be why they aren't as effective for you at the dosage you are taking, especially if you are prescribed to take them twice a day.  It's really important that you discuss the symptoms you are still having with your prescribing provider, as well as when you are taking the medications so they understand the details of your situation and can determine if or how to modify your dosage.  These providers know a lot about the medication process and the more info they have, the better they can meet your needs.  They are ultimately the ones that will work with you to decide whether or not Xanax is the best for you and your situation.I definitely understand your concern that your provider may basically take away how you cope with panic attacks.  That's a scary thought!  Prescribing providers are typically trained in detecting medication abuse, and it is very common for people with anxiety issues to request higher dosages.  I have had plenty of clients ask for increased dosage.  Not only can this get you the assistance you need at the time you need it, but give you a voice in your treatment.  You may end up using that same voice for request to lower your dosage in the future.I do feel an ethical duty to let you know about some of the dangers of Xanax.  Benzodiazepines are depressants and work on the central nervous system (CNS) to do things like slow down your heart rate, breathing, etc. (as you can feel when they do work).  They should never be taken with any other depressants, such as alcohol, barbiturates, and other medications in the Benzo family.  Combinations like these could be fatal.Another danger is that there's a common pattern of relapse after discontinuing Xanax.  This means that symptoms tend to come back stronger than they were before taking the drug.  The reason for this is because when you are taking Xanax, your brain tries to intensify your fear reaction to override the drug.  So when you discontinue it, your fear reactions are still at those heightened levels.  Your prescribing provider can talk to you more about that and/or the process of tapering off the medication to make that less likely when that time comes for you.If you are in counseling and doing exposure activities, (being exposed to things you fear and sitting through the anxiety response) Xanax does interfere with this process.  The brain can't learn a different response if you feel calm.  This is something your counselor (if you have one) can discuss with you as well.The last thing I'd like to say is that there could be some value to practicing other ways to manage your anxiety if you want to make more long-term changes.  That decision is completely yours!  If/when you feel ready to do that, a counselor can help you learn how to move through anxiety without being as reliant on Xanax.  I hope this is helpful and you find what you need!","This is a pretty good question. I would consider the following factors before asking your psychologist about changing your medication, if she prescribed Xanax, this is a very important question to ask: 

It is very common to have difficulty when taking prescription and stimulant medications. The 0.5mg is a very reasonable dose for you, that does not require much in terms of your use of Xanax.   If you take 1mg during an anxiety attack and calm yourself down, you may be able to increase this to 1mg more for an anxiety attack.   If it is not working for you, then perhaps you might consider consulting with your therapist about what you can do with your anxiety.   They could also look at the possibility of reducing your dose of Xanax.   There are many different therapies for anxiety, and you should consider if those are a possibility for you.   In order to properly know if you are using Xanax to cope with anxiety symptoms, it may be useful to ask your psychologist whether or not your use is helping your anxiety. The way the effects of Xanax are used may sometimes be confusing and different from what the cause of the anxiety is.   With different treatments you may find that the issue is related to what you are feeling, rather than your symptoms or needs."
"He leaves and is gone for days or weeks but stays in contact and tells me he misses me. He gets defensive when I ask him stuff. We haven't had sex in two months. He says it's because he's not working, I'm pregnant, he doesn't like it here, and he hasn't been on the mood lately.","Well, there certainly is distance he creates between the two of you.Whether or not the reason is from his cheating on you is impossible to tell based only on the information here provided.You could open a general discussion about the lack of closeness you feel.   Maybe he'll be more responsive to talk about emotions than about specific actions he's done or not done.Mostly, entitle yourself to the quality relationship you'd like to have.  Your discomfort and distress are valid and there's no good reason to live with conditions which keep these moods in place, forever.Give yourself time to plan your next move, especially since having a baby will add to each of your responsibilities.You didn't write how long the problem you describe has continued.One possible outcome if its been a short time, is he will resolve whatever currently drives his withdrawn behaviors from you.Your life, your outcome.Trust yourself to know when the time is right to stay or to go.","I think the most important thing is to acknowledge the emotional state of your partner.  One of the biggest problems in these types of relationships is the ability for partners to communicate non-verbally and non-verbally; it's difficult, if not impossible, to have such intimate conversations.  You may have a good sense of what he is feeling, but you may not be sure if he is, at his core, more supportive or less?  If this is a long-term situation, there are several things that you can do; one way to approach this is by agreeing to a one-on-one weekend of two or three days where he comes home and you two reconnect as a couple.  If he agrees, you can find a couple's retreat or therapy, or even just talk together a couple of days at a time to work through the issues.   You could even work with a local therapist to work through the couple's relationship.  If this relationship is based on intimacy, it is the first three things to consider.  The second thing you can do is communicate, in a very calm and measured way, the things that you need from him, as well as the things that bother you.      It is also important to be sure he is feeling this same way about the relationship, or that this isn't for him."
My girlfriend just quit drinking and she became really depressed. She told me that she wants to move. What can I do to help her? I want her to stay.,"You're probably not going to like my answer.Your question says a lot about what YOU want rather than what she wants or what may be best for her. Sometimes, what's best for a person is the hardest thing to do, and may be completely opposite of what YOU want.Addictions don't happen in a vacuum. If you've had any experience with addicts at all, then I'm sure you've heard the term ""enabler"". A lot of the times, when people think they're ""helping"", they're actually enabling the addict to continue their self-destructive behavior. Tough love and clear boundaries are needed in a lot of situations, but especially with addictions. Family and friends are often the biggest contributing factor to someone choosing to use/drink, continuing to do so, or relapsing back into it.You said she recently quit. You said she is depressed. She wants to move. When a person receives counseling for addictions, they are encouraged to make changes like this. They need to break the habit, and this means removing people from their lives at times. It means moving to new locations. Anything that may trigger a relapse needs to be identified and removed. Not only that, but the addict needs to do a lot of personal reflection to figure out WHY they use/drink in the first place, and not only break the physical addiction to it, but deal with whatever is the root cause that led them to use in the first place. She may need some time alone to figure out who she is as a person, time to make some decisions for herself and do what she needs to do to be healthy.Don't pressure her to stay. Let her have the freedom to do what she needs to do. If she stays, the decision needs to be hers and hers alone. It doesn't need to be made under pressure. That will only lead to resentment. Support her, but don't try to change her or make her do anything, especially for selfish reasons. Let her go. It sounds like she needs some time to focus on herself right now. It wouldn't be a bad idea for you to do the same.","If your girlfriend's depression and depression is caused by alcohol addiction, then you must seek help as soon as possible. Alcohol is a depressant. Alcohol addiction is not something that she can overcome on her own. It will likely be part of the problem and cause the depression. It is very possible that your girlfriend is not ready to stop drinking on her own and the support system that is coming to her is not strong enough to allow her to change. Here are some things you can do to help her:
1. Give her a 30-day no-alcohol rule. This means that she won't be allowed to drink at any time. 
2. Be supportive of her. She is not alone, and you are a good support for her. 
3. Understand she needs a bigger support system than you. Alcohol can create this and it is a good thing to note. 
4. Ask her for support from her friends, family, and others in her life. 
5. Focus on her physical health. Alcohol is a depressant and the good news is that her body is stronger than any physical habit. 
6. Alcoholism is not something that is easily overcome, but it is possible for someone to overcome. There are several places that can help her. The first one she can contact is the local Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. Then the next one is the SAMHSA Treatment Locator to find a local facility that can help her overcome alcohol addiction.                                                                                                                                           �"
"My husband’s ex-wife married a man who was charged with seven felony counts of pandering involving a minor. He, by his own admission, is addicted to child pornography. My step-daughters are now all teenagers. They do not know. My husband’s ex-wife has kept this information from my step-daughters. The step-father has had issues regarding his pornography addiction recently. The ex-wife minimizes it by saying that he has ""repented."" It is a constant strain on my husband, knowing that his girls are living with a man who is addicted to child pornography. My own therapist believes the girls should be told. The ex-wife says her therapist says the opposite.",If the daughters are old & mature enough to understand substance abuse.  They should be told for their own empowerment. KNOWLEDGE is their power of safety and protection.,"It seems the ex-wife's advice doesn't match her therapist's advice! It seems she's trying to manipulate you, but she does not make any logical sense. Your husband's therapist does not provide valid or helpful advice in this case. Perhaps there is a therapist available to take over your communication with her. This seems to be the most logical step.  The ex-wife is likely trying to isolate you from your husband, but you have a valid ground for raising your kids."
"I have PTSD from childhood events and other traumas as an adult. I have panic attacks, nightmares, anger, and at times depression. I feel like I'm always on the edge or just apathetic. Can I fix this by myself?","When it comes to trauma, especially in the event that it has caused you to develop PTSD, there can be a lot of difficulty in attempting to resolve these issues on your own simply because of how strong your urge to avoid it whenever thoughts of the traumatic experience come up. PTSD is best treated with the help of a mental health professional and if using the Cognitive Processing Approach can be treated in as few as 17 weeks. As for your other concerns, many of these can be treated independently if you have the motivation to manage your way through. Panic attacks and depression, specifically, often respond well to self-help treatment manuals. The Centre for Clinical Interventions is a great online resource for workbooks to help you learn to manage the depression and panic attacks. Whether you decide to work through these concerns on your own or in professional therapy, just know that your panic attacks must be managed prior to addressing your trauma. Hope this is helpful and if you have any other questions don't hesitate to ask.","There is no question that you're a person with a lot of capacity to heal. Trauma doesn't *erase* you. It simply changes you! It changes the ways you process the past and how you see the world. You are an experienced person. The trauma has done what it has, it has become the ground beneath your feet. In addition you have a deep well of resilience, compassion and the ability to go forward with your life. The key is to work with you so that you can move through these new experiences in order to be a fully engaged person. This includes addressing symptoms you are experiencing, and learning how to be less reactive to them.   Do you know where to go for help in feeling anxious? There are many therapists, and there are also many other options.  You'll need to decide what works best for you."
"I used to be the funny guy of the group—the class clown, if you will. I used to laugh uncontrollably all the time and be able to be social without it feeling awkward. Now I can't laugh at all, and I'm dead inside.","If you look back to when you feel as though you were the ""funny guy,"" I wonder what is different now? It may be that responsibilities have changed or any number of other things.I don't know whether you're also saying that you feel sad or if you're saying that you feel as though you don't have any big changes in your feelings.A lot of us tend to be really busy, and sometimes we over schedule ourselves to the point that we don't have time to have positive time for ourselves. Sometimes even if we are spending time with friends, we're thinking about work and all of the other things we need to do.I wonder if it feels awkward when you're with friends that you trust in an environment that you are used to. Maybe if that is more comfortable for you, it can be a stepping stone to focusing on how you feel better in those moments.It sounds as if you may have had an experience (or more than one) where you felt misunderstood or criticized and now reacting to people feels awkward. If so, try going back to people you trust. Who do you have support from?","The funny guy of the class you once knew is a great and important part of your sense of self. For people who love a good laugh they are likely to be very open and receptive to the possibility of change that you are hoping to make.I would also suggest checking out the book ""The Way of Thinking about Your Own Reactions"" by Dr. James Hollis. The author provides useful guidelines for the ""reaction"" part of the mind and helps people realize that our feelings are not always based on reality."
"I have an eating disorder of binging. I've had gastric sleeve surgery. I need help with issues of abuse as a child, addiction, and abusive men. I have been in therapy for five months and get no feedback from my therapist.","It can be really frustrating to feel like your counselor is not providing you with the help you need.My recommendation in a situation like this would be to let your counselor know how you feel. Specifically tell Your counselor that you don't seem to be getting the amount of feedback you would like.If this doesn't help, then you might want to look for another counselor who will be a better fit for you.","This is the time to be sure that this is a good fit for you. One reason why I think this is a good fit for you is because as you described it, there are lots of questions you need to address before you can feel comfortable being yourself. I know, for many people this is a little daunting or scary and scary to be alone in a room trying to find the words out to express what you feel so sad or so confused that you do not have a clear voice. You may want to talk with other people that are going through similar experiences, too. If so, there are online groups you can join or your friend or family member that can be a voice for you.  If you are feeling alone, you should reach out. I'm sure there are other people out there who care about you and who have felt the same way that you are feeling. There is help available, whether you choose to take it or not.  Do you want to give up on your therapy? It's completely normal to start getting uncomfortable with your therapist because you're working on helping yourself, but if you are not feeling good about it you probably want to change therapists so that you are working with someone that has a better understanding of what you need."
How can I know if I'm just being paranoid?,"Hi Texas,Oh, that's a powerful idea, isn't it? It burrows into your head. Let's figure this out. First, has your partner given you any concrete reason not to trust them? Have they cheated before? If not, then they deserve the benefit of the doubt until there is evidence. If it's a ""yes"", then it's natural that these fears would be triggered and you can simply let your partner know what triggers the fear and what you need. ""When you refuse to let me see your phone I worry that you're hiding something. I need openness"". If they haven't cheated on you in the past, there are three possible scenarios here. I invite you to take a moment and write down what the evidence is that cheating is going on. What is the specific thing that's triggering your fears? When you have your data recorded, read on...The first scenario is that you have been personally hurt in the past by someone else and you've developed fears that you will be hurt again or that you're not enough to keep someone interested (this is just fear...people cheat for their own reasons, not because we're not interesting). This may be true if what you wrote down is ""They didn't really do anything wrong...there is no evidence. I'm just scared and suspicious"". That's a cue to do some self reflection and calm yourself with thoughts like ""nothing has really happened. I can trust.""If what you wrote down was vague evidence, like for example your partner has been distant or irritable, or you're having less sex than usual, you can try to approach the situation without making assumptions. Trust your gut, but your gut isn't seeing evidence of cheating...it's evidence of ""something"". Ask your partner what's up with accusations or assumptions.The third possibility is that there is some clear evidence that they are cheating. Maybe there are texts on a phone, or someone has told you something they saw. I'd say when there is some evidence, it's okay to present this to your partner and ask what's going on. If this happens repeatedly, and your gut is screaming and there are only excuses or explanations that don't make sense, then it's okay to do a bit of ""research"" and be extra aware of what's going on around you. I hope that helps.","Dear Doctor,

Let me ask, if I am paranoid, am I a doctor? I had a similar question about some other people and I was unsure. I am an adult living in the United States. I have not worked for many years, and if I did have some sort of job, I may have found myself in a place where I had to care for others, something very similar to what I do in therapy now.I think it's possible that I would have a lot of difficulty with this one or the other. And I do have a lot of friends and I might have more time in my life than is healthy.It also could be true that I may have some issues with my social anxiety.I really don't know if I have some kind of physical issue that I am unaware of, but I did notice that my face and my eyes felt very sore some days.Maybe I am just really tired or maybe I was sleep-deprived.  What do you suggest I do?  Do you think I am just being paranoid or am I actually having some mental health issues? Do you think I should speak to a mental health professional?"
We do communicate but one of us has trouble accepting what the other person says. How can I fix things?,"Being able to accept your partner's influence is a key relationship skill. And it's very two sided.  Chances are if you don't feel your partner is being influenced by you, they likely don't feel you are being influenced by them either. The best fix you can practice is to soften yourself into your partner and see how much more open you can be to their influence.  Play with it.","I found this to be my question, and I wish I could tell myself it is something that was previously considered to be un-resolvable. I wish this same question was asked of you, now, because it is too late for that question. If you were asking me, I would say that the answer is that your partner may not be able to accept what your partner says. Some people can be hard to accept because they may be too angry or sensitive in their situation. I would recommend that if your partner cannot accept what you have to say, than either of you need to seek out professional help with communication or to work through how to best cope."
"I have PTSD. The side effects are really bad and have impacts on sex, anger and my relationships. I even lost my job month ago.    How can I get my life back?","Slowly is the rate at which you'll get back your life.Being traumatized means not feeling safe in almost all areas of life.Be patient with yourself as you try to regain trust that people will not harm you and will be sources of satisfaction in your life.It is possible that the trauma in your life requires such great attention on your part to your own inner emotional safety that you are better off with a less intensive job than the one you recently lost.Try to prioritize restoring your emotional and psychological health.  With this as the top area of your attention then you may have an easier time to accept a lesser degree of involvement in your work and relationships.When you feel angry, try to examine if underlying the anger are feelings of stress, fear, insecurity regarding your position in relationship to the person toward whom you feel angry.   Anger is often the surface reaction to more destabilizing emotions like fear and insecurity.Gradually by nurturing and comforting yourself, living at a pace which is uniquely comfortable to what and how much you can handle, you'll regain your trust in both yourself and relating to others.","It's very good to begin to work through the experience of PTSD. The fact that you've lost your job and that you lost your sex can be quite difficult.  Let's talk about what we can do to help you feel more safe and at peace with you. Most people experience these side effects when they move from their previous life where they weren't always going to work.  Often, things that we've been trying to avoid in the past, the ones that we thought would be better, they are now the things that we need to focus on and be okay with. I can write you a plan to take the right actions in your life. I would suggest talking to your primary care physician about your symptoms to see if there's any medical consideration for you. Also, there are some support groups and professionals who help individuals with PTSD to live fuller and healthier lives. Here are a few recommendations: <a href=""https://www.thebackgain.org/"">(https://www.thebackgain.org/)?gt;The Backgain](https://www.thebackgain.org/)?You can find a local treatment center on the website. The backgain is a group of therapists who provide help and support for individuals who have been through trauma. There is no cost for these appointments. I would strongly advise you to start with these as the first step and get out of the hospital. I hope you can feel better soon."
"I'm dating this guy, Peter. My friend Jennifer used to date him a while ago, and she's fine with us dating. My ex-boyfriend, Paul, broke up with Jennifer, and she's devastated about it. Peter and I are going through a rough patch in our relationship. All of a sudden, Paul is in ""love"" with me, and he wants me back. I don't know what to do because I can't hurt my friend or my boyfriend, but I think I might Paul again.","Hello. The dynamics of having a romantic relationship with someone is not always clear. Sometimes we jump from one relationship to another without giving ourselves a chance to adjust and grieve for the one we had to leave behind. When you find yourself in a situation where a previous partner is coming back into your life and desires to be with you again, it is important to ask yourself what the motivations are prompting that return. Is the person afraid of being alone? Are they jealous of your current relationship? Do you feel the same way about this returning relationship as you did before it was ended? How long and/or how committed is the current relationship you are in now with your current partner? Does your former partner not like being ""dumped"" and maybe they just want to get back together with you so that they can ""dump"" you instead? Some of these questions you may not be able to answer, and some of them might require your own internal reflection.You likely want to make a good decision, and you also might want to consider who it will impact, and how that will happen. Other friends might be upset at this sudden change, and it could create a strain on your friendship. You will want to carefully consider the value of that friendship before you take any actions that could damage it. Also perhaps think about what led you to end the relationship with your previous partner in the first place. Has there been a change in events or behavior that would cause you to think of a valid reason to give that person a second chance? How it will it impact your current relationship?Going into relationships should be done with reflection, patience, and full awareness. Ultimately you choose who is in your life, so you want to make those choices based on appropriate decision making, and with the ability to protect yourself from harm. No one else can make this choice for you. However, gaining the insight of friends or family can be helpful, as can seeking out the counsel of a therapist. In your heart, you will likely find the right answer. Learn to trust that more, as that is where the core of emotion tends to be when you need it. Use your mind to analyze things, but allow yourself to also feel your way through the situation too. The answer will arrive if you let it.","You look at your options and decide to take a chance on Paul because he is in love with you, Jennifer is sad because she thinks you're angry with her as well as Paul isn't being clear in his intentions. I'd say no to this since you are having a fight with Paul as well as you need to have your act together. If you continue to have a fight with Paul, you are going to lose me over the long run. You are still immature as it would be hard to trust anyone in your life. What is more important for you than his feelings is his feelings. It does not matter that you are going to feel hurt or angry, and he may be upset as well, so don't let that get to you. You need to make your own decisions and accept the ones that you are making."
"I'm scared that I am with this man so I won't be alone. He should be with somebody who deserves him if this is the case, and I don’t want to hurt him.","While not wanting to be alone may not be the best reason to be in a relationship, it is probably more common and normal a reason than you think.  Since you seem to care about your friend (""don't want to hurt him""), I imagine there are many other reasons that you are together.  I suggest that you talk about this open-heartedly with each other.  The idea of being afraid of being alone sounds like an honest starting place.  Don't try to ""figure out"" whether you should be with him.  Just talk.  The communication is likely to shine light on deepening connection for BOTH OF YOU.In the meantime, your idea that you don't deserve him is rooted in a ""core lie"" that you are telling yourself.  You can read about ""core lies"" and much more in my book, Living Yes, a Handbook for Being Human.  Check out www.LivingYes.org.Be easy on yourself.  You are deserving!~Mark","You are trying to do what is right for the man. You are concerned about how you might feel if he gets hurt so you are trying to protect him. You are also concerned that if he's with someone else, then that means that they don't get enough attention and affection, which may mean that he doesn't get enough of that. I would argue that it's okay for him to be with someone who makes him happy. If your feeling is like that, then you should be happy if you choose who you want to be with. If you really feel that something isn't right about the situation, talk to a trusted friend or family member about it."
"I am going through a divorce from a narcissistic sociopath who left me for another woman after mentally and emotionally abusing me for 11 years. I have moved to a different state and after giving up my successful business am working as a server at a restaurant. I’m coping as best as I can. Is it normal and healthy to not adapt as quickly and be as strong as I think I should be? I am astounded at his cruelty and how much he doesn't care, as well as most other people in my life. I feel like I don't exist to anyone anymore as there is no contact from anyone who I thought cared about me. My brother just said no to lending me a few hundred dollars for me to live on. I am losing faith in humanity itself.","I am very sorry to hear of your struggles. I think that it is normal to struggle to get your feet under you again after a divorce, especially after leaving a relationship that lasted 11 years, so try not to be too hard on yourself. Take it one day at a time and do the best you can.I notice that you said he left you. This tells me that you didn’t have the strength to leave him on your own despite the fact that you say he was emotionally and mentally abusive and also cheating on you. Low self-esteem can keep someone in a bad relationship because they think they can’t do any better. Also, abusers will make you think that they are the best thing you can get. The way I see it, he did you a favor. You are now free to make your own life whatever you want it to be. Take this time alone to work on you. As hurtful as it may be that other people don’t want to help you, this is something that you need to do for yourself without feeling like you need someone in your life to take care of you. Your statement “I don’t feel like I exist anymore” tells me that in addition to low self-esteem, you also don’t have a clear sense of identify and rely on the people in your life to help define who you are. People can and will let you down. It is important for you to learn to handle disappointment, learn to take care of your own needs, and to gain a stronger sense of self. Do nice things for yourself every day because you deserve it. Even if it is just to soak a little longer in a hot bubble bath, do something that makes you feel good. Find a hobby that you enjoy. Look in the mirror and tell yourself some positive affirmations daily. Google “positive affirmations” to find some that resonate with you. Such statements might be “I am a good person who deserves to be happy” or “I can do this.” Some relaxation and meditation exercises may help you as well. There are some free meditation exercises that you can find online by doing a simple Google search.Take this time to focus on you and try not to worry about what everyone else in your life is doing. When you are a happier, more stable person, the right people will come into your life without you even looking for them. Good luck with rebuilding your life. I know it is hard! Remember to take it one day at a time.","The narcissistic kind is a really bad person but can get away with being rude or abusive at times. So maybe you feel like it's not normal to change as quickly or as strongly as people expect. It is pretty normal to not adjust as quickly or as strongly as others expect.&#x20;Many people don't adapt as quickly as people assume they should adapt. It's much more common to be confused by the change that you've gone through than to be shocked by whether the others have changed or not. Your brother said ""No."" You can get some comfort from this advice. If you're doing this for emotional support, it's probably okay to leave this behind if you have more control over your response. You can only learn how to respond to the person you are interacting with. You need to get a grip on what you have to do! You're also on a tight budget. If your brother is in a position to not be supportive, you will be in the most difficult position of all. The worst part is you are not getting what you expected. You have a choice here! It is common for people to stay angry and resentful for reasons that the other person doesn't understand. If you are willing to take a step back and see it for what it is, and focus on your own well being, then you will find more hope and contentment in your life. It would make you feel less lonely in the long run, too."
"I can't seem to feel any emotion except anxiety, not even for myself.","Thank you for posting.  I'm interested to hear some more information; such as, if you live by yourself or family, if you go to school/employed/unemployed, and what kind of things do you like to do with friends or by yourself.  Often times, when we are experiencing a strong emotion that we interpret as negative, we put most of our focus on that negative emotion and struggle to see that we do not always feel that specific emotion.  There are typically points in the day (even if it is for only in 1 minute intervals) when we do not feel that negative emotion.  When we overgeneralize, we use words like ""always"" or ""never"" and when we use those words and it may not be totally true, we feel the negative emotion based on an inaccuracy which is not fair to you.  Ask yourself some of these questions: Am I being realistic when I'm overgeneralizing things? Have I ever noticed a short period of time that I wasn't feeling anxious?  What do I notice when I am feeling anxious? What am I thinking about?  When was the last time I felt empathy?  What was different when I was able to feel empathy?  Hopefully this helps get you started.","Hello there! This sounds like a lot to deal with...  I wonder if anxiety, as you feel it. is like a shield around you. This shield protects you from real painful experiences which are often associated with intense feelings and emotions. If we see the need for protection and safety, some of our brain parts may turn towards suppressing a lot of positive emotions, like happiness and excitement and love.  If your brain is busy creating the shield, is it more likely to see you feel the emotional changes that you may have wanted to feel in the first place?  The way the body react to anxiety is the body is the first to move to the other side of the shield. Sometimes people feel like they are stuck and not able to react emotionally. It sounds like you'd like to feel more emotions, as you are asking.  However, it takes energy to build a shield and the body is telling you to calm down and take some time to let go of it. It's worth remembering that you don't have to 'feel' everything, but maybe in general, the opposite of your feelings, is a good place to start to begin feeling more.  If you're feeling more of a balance of positive emotions instead of negative ones, it might be helpful to work with your therapist to work through this if you find this is the way you're feeling, the goal of therapy is to help you start living the life you want."
"My wife and I have a great relationship except for our sex lives. We are pretty transparent and honest, and basically, she feels bad because she never wants to have sex. She doesn't have the desire. She's also never orgasmed. She feels like a terrible wife and fears I'll cheat on her. She doesn't know why. Last time we had sex, she cried and felt bad and didn't know why she cried. However, she also told me that the last time we had sex, she felt me in her, but it just felt ""ehh"" and wanted to stop. That makes me feel really awful. We rarely have foreplay. Everything I try tickles her, so she makes me stop. We are both frustrated but very much in love. She and I are in our early 20s. We’re married and we have a baby on the way.","I suggest seeking the support of an AASECT certified sex therapist to help work through much of the issues you address, you simply may need some really qualified support. Also, you might be interested in watching Esther Perel's ted talk on the secret to desire in a long term relationship, and/or you might want to sign up for my own 8-part-series on Reconnecting Parent Couples","I have some questions for you so we can have a better understanding of what you're facing. When you say you ""just don't know why,"" what do you mean? Is there a specific reason that you feel that way? Is there anything you would like you to happen more frequently? Is there anything that you would want me to ask you. I am not sure what you mean by ""ehh"", but what about when we have sex, do you always feel like I'm there?Do you always feel like I'm there? Do you know if there's a difference in how you feel about having sex with me? When you say it's not a big deal and you don't want to keep going, it's not something that you're expecting to change this time, and now it seems like both of us, a guy and my wife, want to explore getting to know each other better. I am confused if there is a reason why both of us aren't feeling satisfied in the first place.  Perhaps we could look through your own relationship records and I would love to see what you were like when you were younger. I don't want to know any more than you are willing to share and that it's up to you if you're ready to talk about it."
I'm obsessing about a terrible breakup. Everything is a constant reminder. How do I move on?,"Let yourself know what you feel.   There is no timetable or known length of how much time a particular person requires in order to feel that the dissolved relationship is behind them.Probably the more you allow yourself to acknowledge your sadness from seeing the reminders, the sooner you will feel fresh and new again.","I wonder how you're feeling, how it's going in your life now to be alone and sad. If you were to talk to someone who truly understood you, you would have a good sense of what you truly felt about your new situation. Perhaps you will feel lonely, perhaps you will feel lonely because you feel you need more in your life. If the other reason is why you are lonely then I highly recommend talking to someone who knows about and understands your situation. It may take some courage to say something. It's brave because you are looking for help.  I wish you good luck moving on with this. I hope it is not too long for you to move on, or that there is a possibility of having a more positive relationship with you and your ex. But more than anything, I wish you luck when you find someone new and start a new chapter in your life with someone who truly cherishes you."
"I'm in my mid 20s with a husband and children. I love my family, but I feel like I've lost my identity, and I don't know who I am other than a mom and wife. At times, all I can think is what I gave up and how I feel unhappy and trapped, but I know I'd feel like worse without them. I loathe myself at times. I have an amazing life, so why can't I just enjoy it?","Good for you on being sensitive to your human need for personal evolution.Wife and mother are meaningful positions.  And in your case, in order to feel your own growth, other areas of who you are would like your attention.Give yourself time to allow your interest to wander in order to find the area of growth which will satisfy you.Just like you know now that you'd like more than your current situation, trust yourself to know you will also know when you've arrived at another road you'd like to take for your own happiness.","I understand the question I am asking for you to keep coming back to myself as if you are the only one who is thinking about this for a few more years. It sounds like you may want to think about this for another year or two. At one point, you had 2, and then 2+2 were 4. One day you were happy and in love with him. Then, you are sad, and he is sad. So he says ""I love you"" and you tell him that you want him to leave. You start to question whether you love him and if he loves you! All of this is so emotional and sad. I think it would be best for you to talk to someone in a long time, maybe a therapist or doctor. But most of all, you would also need time to heal."
My grandma and brother both passed away 11 years ago and sometimes at night I just can't stop crying while thinking about the good memories we had but won't have ever again. I can't sleep at night when the memories and tears come I'll be fine all day then at night...boom! it's like waterfalls from my eyes. Why can't I stop crying?,"Because you're sad and miss the relationship you had w grandma and your brother.The academic point that grief takes a different length of time to lift for each person, is true.Also, from a spiritual perspective, your grandma and brother are still here in loving relation to you, just not in physical body.  Pay attention if you have a sense of talking to them within your mind.  This may lessen your feeling of loss.When you're done crying about missing them, your grief will simply disappear on its own!  It cannot be forced to leave.","There may not be a single answer to why you cry when you're remembering your grandmother and brother that isn't just grief in itself! Grief is a terrible and complicated process, even for people who live with the knowledge of their loss, so many have very hard times remembering things they've lost.   Grief can make the brain feel cold and a little bit numb at times, especially after a time, like the death of your grandmother and brother, where you spent time with them.  Because the people you've lost have disappeared from your life, the memories are like a heavy blanket you try to keep over your eyes. So now you're trying to hold onto those memories, but holding onto something you know isn't going to help you move on from the fact that you lost them. There are many ways to deal with grief, for example, we will talk about it more in therapy.  Sometimes it's helpful to talk to someone about it, and it's especially helpful to talk to someone who has lost a loved one recently. I hope you find a way to find relief from this grief, maybe by watching videos of your grandmother and brother, or visiting the memorial that I know you are thinking about.  The most important thing is to let your tears come freely and get along with it."
"I've been with him for a couple months. We will talk everyday and he will get mad over something I will say and not talk to me. We have our great moments, but I just need to focus on my personal situations, and I feel he is slowing me down with that. I still wanna be with him, but not now.","It sounds like you're pulling away instead of being honest. If you really want to be with him, why not now? If you don't have time for a relationship, why are you dating at all?I don't understand the whole ""phasing out"" thing that people do these days (or ""ghosting"", where you just stop talking and disappear!). I get the sense that this relationship isn't working for you, but for some reason you're stopping yourself from being honest with yourself and him and just ending it. In the early stage of a relationship (the first year), if it doesn't feel fabulous, it's a good idea to move on. It's not personal. You don't owe this person anything. They deserve someone who's totally into them (and so do you) and you're doing him no favors by hanging on to something that's not amazing or giving him hope that it might work better in the future sometime. You don't have to slowly bow out. It actually creates more hurt than gentle honesty. Maybe people don't know how to say it?""I've decided not to continue with this. I wish you the best."" Life is too short!","What you're feeling is common in the first few months of a new relationship. The first 3 months is not a natural or healthy amount of time. With time the relationship begins to develop into something more, a partnership where you have time to spend with each other on all types of things. I'm sure you're doing a great job when you put your best foot forward and focus on your time for yourself. With time, he'll realize that you don't like what he does or that he does not listen to you. But that won't be the only reason he isn't listening or respecting your time. Sometimes, people are just naturally less empathetic. I've found that once he starts doing a little bit better he will focus on doing what he said he would. However, if his actions continue to be disrespectful, you have no guarantee he will actually change to be more respectful to you."
"Sometimes I can't stop thinking about life after death. I was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven.  When I think of living forever (even if it is in heaven which should be good), I feel overwhelmed. I don't like the thought of living forever and ever and ever. Sometimes I just can't get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety.  Am I crazy? I don't think these thoughts are normal.","You might be surprised how normal you are. Anxiety is incredibly common and while your particular type of existential anxiety might be unique to you - it is very difficult for most people to really comprehend what happens after we die - regardless of the religious or philosophical belief systems we hold. It is the ultimate unknown and some philosophers and psychologists believe that at the root of our day-to-day anxieties is the fear of death or fear of the unknown.  Just as it can be really hard to comprehend the ending of life it can also be hard to comprehend an eternal existence. What these both have in common is that we are imaging a future that is ultimately unknowable and this unknown can provoke a lot of anxiety. Mindfulness based practices like meditation - maybe there is something like this in your religious tradition - can be very helpful in making peace with the unknown in the present moment. The more we can learn to live in the moment - the less we get hung up on anticipating outcomes for our lives that may never come true. Mindfulness practices can help you ground, be where you are , relax and regulate your nervous system so that you are able sleep and recuperate, and train your attention to focus on living the life you want to live now - rather than worrying about what happens after you die. Having said all that - it can be profoundly helpful to speak with someone about your anxiety - especially when you feel haunted by it, worry that you are crazy and can't get to sleep. There are lots of good therapists out there who can help you with your anxiety.","In general, life is full of a natural cycle of coming and going. So, this is the same for the spiritual and physical realm.  I think many people have had difficult experiences with their faith that would lead them to question this issue.  After all, a lot of people have been telling people they're dead. They are usually dead in their own way.  It's also possible that the first thing many people try is to just get over the fear and let go. It can be really hard for people who have this question to move on though."
"My boyfriend says I'm nuts. I need to get help because I get an overwhelming feeling that he is cheating on me. Whenever I try to talk with him about it, he always turns it around on me by telling me what I'm doing wrong. I know that accusing him does not help. When his whole demeanor shifts towards me, I can't help but think that something is wrong. Am I wrong for feeling this way? I try to talk with him to make it better. I let him know when I am feeling down. But I am not confident in these things.  Two weeks ago a girl texted his phone 3 times trying to hook up with him. He texted her back with ""Sorry, I've been working. I just read your message."" The girl was trying to get him to call her at a time when he was at home with me. He texted her back with ""Don't text me anymore."" I don't feel like I am way out of the line. But I can't talk with him if all that he will say is that I'm crazy and I need help. What should I do? How will I go about checking if there really is something wrong with me?","Trust your intuition that your boyfriend is involved with other people.You gave examples which strongly suggest this.Quite commonly, a person twist someone's words to convince then of having problems in seeing or understanding their own and other's behavior.Your intuition is again working quite well in telling you that your problem is having a boyfriend who manipulates you, not that you're seeing things incorrectly.One way to check if you're totally misreading him, is to examine whether you feel similarly in other relationships.If no one else who knows you tells you that you're crazy, then this strongly points to your boyfriend twisting words so that you feel wrong.Also, a consult with a therapist would clarify the dynamics between you and your boyfriend.A therapist session would also allow you to think out loud in a confidential discussion, what to do with your newfound clarity!","The truth is that in the relationship, one person's perception of things may be completely different than another person's perception. Sometimes people tend to avoid emotional confrontation in therapy, or at least it is one of their ways of dealing with relationships and emotional problems. Often, when the relationship becomes bad, people become even more angry and hostile and they try to avoid this kind of conflict. When you are very angry, it is much harder to communicate openly and effectively. In such a relationship, you will feel that you are in over your head. What you are feeling is possibly fear of confrontation, but also a fear of being abandoned by the other person. It is almost as if the other person has other things going on in their life that we are unaware of. However, it is you who has the need for validation. What does it mean to be loved and supported by someone who you care about so deeply?What is the need of another person as an adult? Are they jealous, anxious, paranoid, or what? What does another person feel as a young person?It is often easy to understand someone else’s point of view. People tend to assume that others are being more emotionless than themselves. As a child, we may not have had the opportunity to fully express how we feel, and this, in turn, leads to emotional problems. The question to ask yourself here is ""how do I know that other people's emotional reactions are different from my own?"" Do they seem to say they are angry at you and you seem to have been angry at them, or do they seem to have different reactions to your same level of aggression? These are tricky questions, and there are no simple answers to them. But hopefully the answers you seek will lead you to the point where you begin to question your own beliefs."
"I'm a male in my 20s. My girlfriend is in her late 30s. She's great. She's funny and smart, she has a big heart, and we have an excellent sex life. She recently moved in with me partially because she wanted to and partially because she had no place to go. We fight a lot. It’s mostly my fault, I must admit. She doesn't like my insecurity and lack of trust I have for her. I have trust issues. Also, I can't fathom why a woman like her is with me, so I'm always dreading when a better dude will come along. I don't think she's happy. She's very submissive and she loves me very much, but also the fact that she has nowhere to go must be influencing her decision to stay. I love her so much, but my jealousy is not likely to diminish. I never believed in the whole ""If you love them, let them go,"" but I do now. I really want her to be happy. Should I end it with her? She has no place to go so I feel like I can’t break up with her. I’m literally trapped.","Hi Fort Worth,  I applaud your awareness and insight into the relationship.  Most of us come into relationships carrying old baggage and although you can't change her,  what you can do, is change yourself.  We can usually begin to understand ourselves better in the context of our own upbringings.  That is where we learn what a relationship looks like and it is often not the best teacher.  I wonder about your jealously, insecurity, feeling trapped and a lack of trust.  Has that ever showed up anywhere before?  It has more to do with you and less to do with her.   Your relationship with her is tapping into unresolved issues within yourself.  That is really where you want to focus. Once you understand it and resolve it, you will no longer need to ask anyone else what to do, because you will know.  You are young and just getting started in the relationship world and the healthier you are, the better you will know what healthy looks like.   Know yourself, understand yourself and love yourself.  The rest will take care of itself.  Finding a Therapist can be a big help in this process.  You are asking the question, so I suspect you are ready to look at the man in the mirror.  I believe in you and am wishing you all the best.Sandra Cooper, RN, LPCMH","First I must say what I'm hearing here in this situation is 1: That you don't really trust her. 2: That she does not want to move in with you. 3: Her feelings are valid and she is not unhappy. 4: That the ""better dude"" does not want to be with you. 5: I am also jealous.  I am so guilty that if I had been better at taking care of myself that it might not be like this. I feel guilty for her choice to be with me. 6: ""I love them so much"" is true, but love and guilt are not the same thing. What I need is something to do to calm the guilt. I also know that my feelings of jealousy are likely coming from a place of fear. I am afraid of losing my girlfriend, being left alone, and not having the right to love her. When I feel such strong jealousy about my girlfriend, I also feel some shame I don't want to admit.I think this is where the real fear is coming from. The guilt and shame will likely make this less comfortable than it is now, but can be something we can work through and stop holding onto the past and dwelling on it. 4: Her desire to go somewhere else is what is needed. 5: I am worried because if she wants to be happy then her happiness is in her own hands. I'm not here to help her find a place to live with me but to support her as she makes her own decisions and find her own happiness. 6: 1: What is truly important to me is that she knows that I love her, but the fact that I am jealous and insecure for her feels wrong. You don't need to get to know her better so that you know what to say to her when you need to! What is important to me is that she know that it is me that's causing the jealousy. When I'm able to admit it to my self, then I'm sure she knows this is true.If you and she know what you're feeling, then it's easier to come up with how to best treat each other.I do believe that she isn't unhappy, and I think she will be happy if she can't be with you. But I do get the impression she is still happy, but just not in the same way. So her happiness is at risk for no reason.What does her happiness"
"Sometimes, when I look at my pet cat, I think about how innocent he is and how somebody could hurt or kill him. It makes me sad because I love him, but I always think about how helpless he is. There've even been split-seconds where I felt almost tempted to kick him, followed by shame and guilt.","A lot of different things could be happening here. Do you feel angry or sad or anxious when you think about how helpless he is? If you have not actually kicked him, then I would encourage you to look at feelings other than guilt, since you did not hurt him. What else is there?It would probably be very helpful to talk with a therapist about the specifics of this so that you can see what else is happening for you. It could be that you feel safe with your cat, so strong emotions come up because you feel safe.","I'm glad you can feel this way about your cat. Your cat might be alive and well, but he might also be experiencing some deep sense of suffering. The feeling that he could be hurting you or yourself is a very common human experience, and it could show up in different forms and ways, for different types of animals.  The animal body communicates in a way that's just as important as the verbal.  So, you could try talking to him (maybe as a human or a cat), how he feels, how he's doing and if he's feeling good.  He is not responsible for what happen to him, but he is our cat and he is free to ask for help."
"I crossdress and like to be feminine but I am attracted to women, but yet that seems to bother girls I date or ask out.    How can I approach them about it? should I hold back and keep it a secret, or should I just be up-front about it. I wonder if i should stop or if I should continue to do it since it makes me happy. What should I do?","Thanks for asking this question. I think the most important part of what you mentioned was that you do it because it makes you happy. For that reason, I would encourage you to keep doing what makes you happy.As far as telling girls or keeping it a secret, I don't really think that it's necessarily one or the other, at least not the first time that you meet. In other words, one part of your decision-making could be whether it is something that you always want to address in the first date, or perhaps something that you address after you've known each other for a couple of meetings. The answer to that question may also change depending on who you are dating. I would imagine that each person that you are with mainly due to a different decision this was when to disclose this. It sounds like this is an important part of you, so I would think that if you were going to date someone long-term, you would want them to know about the most important parts of you, including that.I also encourage you to remember that if you meet someone who is not comfortable with this, that does not mean that there is anything wrong with what you are doing, but rather something that the other person is in some way deciding not to continue learning about or choosing to have someone they are dating like to cross-dress.I'd also ask you to consider this: Are the people who you say this to expecting it? My guess is that the answer is probably not. Along with that, Are they going to have questions? I would imagine so.Are you comfortable answering questions?I wonder if you could figure out yourself or with friends (or perhaps even with a therapist) how you would answer these sorts of questions:What exactly is cross-dressing?Does that change the gender that you're attracted to?What does it mean to you?Why is it important to you?And what you want your listening person to know about you related to cross-dressing.There could even be ways that you can start the conversation by asking them to be open to listen to you and ask questions about what they are thinking before they make any quick decisions about you or the relationship.I certainly hope that you find the right person for you. I imagine that having this conversation could be stressful, especially considering the idea that you have had some negative reactions in the past. Remember that talking this through with a therapist could be very helpful.","Thank you for making me feel comfortable enough to write down this question. I'd like to share some thoughts that may help you in your journey to find what is best for you in the long-term, however, I cannot prescribe a diagnosis to you.  If there is any anxiety regarding you speaking to someone about something this personal, I do encourage you to seek out a therapist and find someone who does not give diagnoses or treatment prescriptions, then you're in safe hands.  And if you're in this community of crossdressers and people who like to be feminine, you may want to meet other people who identify and dress that way.  Finding these other women can create a whole community for you!  You may discover that you are in a community that welcomes you for you, regardless of your gender.   But no matter where you are with this, don’t try to be somebody you are not.  It's good to be happy, but being consistent with how you are, is important.  I have a lot of people who have the same issue with being cross-dressed, which I don’t think is fair to the people who are being told to stop being cross-dressed.    And I wouldn’t want to assume that anyone who is not a woman is just as bothered by that.   I would hope that as people are trying to change the way they are perceived, they would be trying to be as authentic as they can be, and that includes being able to find what makes them happy.    Most people don’t want to be judged, and they like to have the freedom to be themselves. It may take you some time to figure out what is best for you, but that is okay. And if you do find some way to feel comfortable that includes being cross-dressed or not, then do it!  Trust me, you are not alone in feeling like this.     I hope you and your friends enjoy having these conversations.  I really hope you discover what you love about yourself.       I don’t know the answer to your question, but I do hope you can find your own answer to this."
"Me and my girlfriend just broke up. She said she loves me but is not in love anymore. This came out of nowhere. We seemed so happy together. It all started when she went to Missouri to visit her family. The first week she was there she was fine then once she went to this one sister’s house everything changed. That's when she told me she loved me but was not in love with me anymore. I thought maybe it was just because she missed her family and she just wanted to be home because she told me that she could not leave them again. Then she told me to come to her in Missouri. So that's what I did. I quit my job I dropped everything, said goodbye to my family in Florida and drove 15 straight hours to be with her. Once I got there everything was fine again.  She apologized for everything and said she didn't mean any of it then we were good for about a week. Then she went back to saying she didn’t love me anymore and had no feelings for me. The only thing that really gets me and makes me not want to accept this is that now she is pregnant. This wasn’t an accident. We were trying to get pregnant, so all this is hard to accept. I love her so much. I have never been bad to her. I've treated her the best I can. I wanted her to be my wife. I was going to propose to her when she got back. Now I'm losing my family and my mind. I don't know what to do.","I am sorry to hear of these troubles. I see a few issues here. I wonder why you were both trying to get pregnant when the relationship seemed troubled? Some people think that they can fix a broken relationship by getting pregnant, and all this does is bring up more problems.You say you never treated her badly, and I believe you. People in a relationship can still be unhappy even when there is no abuse or mistreatment going on. In fact, giving too much of yourself to the relationship and not having a “self” outside of this relationship can be unhealthy. It takes two whole, healthy, happy people who are that way when they are single to come together to make a whole, healthy, happy couple in a relationship. Expecting your partner to meet all your needs or to provide your happiness is not going to work.There are two books that I recommend you buy and read. One is Codependent No More. The other is Can My Relationship Be Saved?Sometimes when you cling and try even harder to hold onto someone, it makes you both miserable. You cannot change her and cannot change her mind. Sometimes the best thing is to let go. If it is meant to be, you will end up back together again. It seems like this is something that she needs to decide since she is the one that keeps doing the leaving. I suggest backing off and letting her go. Maybe she needs time to clear her head and make up her mind. If it is meant to be, she will come back. If not, use this time to work on being a healthy happy you on your own.","Good information and great questions to ask yourself. I want to say that the fact that you have not been bad to her is more important to you than the fact that your career is over because you've lost the relationship of your life. When you're in love, your heart is beating with a great deal of joy.I understand why you would not want to accept this and do not know how to be with someone that loves you but isn’t in love with you anymore. As long as it is your partner then you are doing exactly what you need to do. Love will not make you see clearly.Love can be a wonderful experience but it does not have to be a gift of love in every situation.  The fact is that you love your partner more than anything else in this world. You want to be with her, and that is something that you have to accept in your mind. It is that love that makes you feel in love. Love is a beautiful thing and it is one of the things that you want to have in your life. If you don't love her you have to decide if you want to be with her. I wonder how you feel the difference between the two. If you are worried about the state of the relationship you may be unsure about where you are going.  You can't see where you are going but you can see where you are right now.  Your feelings in this moment with her are all you need to tell yourself. I hope that you find what you need in life.I wish you all the best."
"I am always arguing with my father. He gets stressed over work and health and talks to me in a tone of voice that seems very demanding and seems more like yelling. I get upset often at this. Am I too sensitive? He always says I am overreacting but never seems to understand that he is hurting my feelings. No matter how often I try to tell him this, he never listens.","Thanks for the question. Regardless of whether or not you are sensitive, it is okay to want better communication with those who are important to you. When we feel that we are being talked down to or being ridiculed, it is difficult to not take it personally. It sounds like you have taken the first and necessary step in resolving this by bringing up the issue to him. Is it possible that the delivery of your message is causing him to feel blamed or defensive? Try communicating with him during a time when you are not upset and when it is out of context. Begin your statements with ""I"" as opposed to ""you."" For example, you can tell him, ""I feel angry when you raise your voice at me"" instead of ""You always yell at me."" Also, avoid using black and white terms such as never and always. Additionally, offer sugggestions as to ways that he can better communicate with you. Maybe he just doesn't know how to. Lastly, when delivering a message, I like to use the sandwich method by starting off the discussion with something postive and ending it with something postive. For example, you may say something to the effect of:""Dad, I enjoy the discussions we share and really value your opinion. There are times that I feel angry when you talk to me aggressively. Perhaps you can try talking to me using a calmer tone when I bring up heated topics. Let's try and work on this together. I will try to be less sensitive and I am asking that you be more calm.""I hope you find this useful!","I can not hear you respond to the question, however, let's talk about that, with a little encouragement to be a bit more open to letting him know how you are doing. Do you feel that what you are trying to communicate, are you trying to tell him that he has become more angry and upset with you, while you're trying to explain, that you're upset because it is very hard to balance how angry and hurt you feel to each other? How to help him recognize these feelings and work with those in addition to you? Be your own listener and make sure there is a real conversation to occur first, rather than it being a conversation that only you are hearing. Not only do you want him to listen to you, but you also want him to be more aware and open to your feelings. As the first step, you can try asking a little bit more about what is happening in your life and what seems to be bothering him. A great starting point for him is asking for some boundaries in his life, which will allow him to understand what is a boundary for you as well as the needs of your life. Is this about boundaries in your family, about your age, or a mix of both?"
"I've only been married three months. Every week, we argue about something, and it seems to be getting worse.","One key factor to consider is, are you able to repair after your arguments? It seems from your question that repair is lacking after any disagreement or argument. When couples are able to repair after an argument, they have an opportunity to learn more about each other's needs moving forward. I'm also curious if you're having the same type of arguments over and over? If you're stuck in a particular pattern, and can start recognizing what happens between you when this pattern happens, then you can start to name it. Once you name it, then you can take a break to cool off and come back to each after your nervous system has had a chance to calm down (about 30 minutes). The key here though is to make sure you have a plan in place - when things are good between you - an agreement between you that when you both start to get escalated, you'll name it or have an agreed upon code word to signal you don't want to continue this cycle, and then agree to cool off and come back together at a later time. That way, when this is enacted during an argument, nobody feels abandoned during the cool off time. Rather, both partners know they will return at a time when they can truly hear each other and hear their needs.","I think you're probably misinterpreting the issue. The first few months of marriage are usually full of frustration and irritation! It's normal to feel overwhelmed and ask questions, and maybe a little bit confused about how things can be done in a harmonious way. In the early relationship, the most important thing to remember is that you and your spouse are learning together.  Don't be afraid to make mistakes, but don't feel as though it's a reflection of how good you and your spouse are together.  Ask your spouse what they need from you, and listen to what they are saying. What do they need from you? Maybe you're getting too much emotional support and the other person needs more help keeping you from getting overly emotional.  I wonder if they are trying to tell you what you need or who they need with you?  It’s a very big decision, so it is smart to ask your spouse for their insight. \�Be sure to discuss this with your spouse and see how they perceive it. How would they like you to express yourself about you and your relationship?  How would they want your relationship to look in six months? Is it your best?  Don't assume it will be the same six months from now."
"I started seeing this guy that I met at a mutual friend’s place. He recently broke up with his ex-girlfriend and started seeing me. Everything was great in the beginning, then I started having low self-esteem thoughts and thinking he was hanging with his ex-girlfriend again. It’s all I think about. I am still seeing him, but things have changed because I am at a loss for words. I get stuck in my own thoughts. I like and care for him a lot. He just makes me nervous and gives me the butterflies.","Sounds like you are struggling with your own negative thoughts.  As you stated, everything was great then you started having low self-esteem thoughts and thinking.  What is contributing to these negative thoughts?  His actions or your past experiences with unhealthy relationships would be my question..","Is there a part of your past you feel like you're missing? Because if so, if so, maybe he's trying to fill some gap that you've never noticed. If you find a new area to explore, maybe he might understand.  Or, if he can see a similar thing in your feelings and behaviors, he might be glad to connect with you. It does not have to happen this way. The important thing is whether there's a path for him to be on your path."
"He's lied about his past/present situations. Since time has passed, he has changed, but I still have my doubts. I have no idea if I should stay or go, but I hate this feeling. I don't trust him all too much, but yet he hasn't done anything for me not to trust him recently.",Your doubts about your dating partner need to be addressed and solved so you can fully believe him again.Otherwise how would you actually know whether he's lying to you now or not?Start the conversation with him about wanting to trust him and asking for whatever details you feel will give you confidence he is telling you the truth.If he really wants to clear your doubts then he will be willing to invest in answering your extra questions or wanting to look through his phone or whatever areas you felt were violated by him in the past.,Do you know who you really trust?
"I got sick really bad and was throwing up for three days and nights. I thought I was going to die. Then about a week later, I started having this desire to be female. I never had this desire before. All I can think about is being a woman. I don't get pleasure from my penis anymore either. Women are attractive, but not like before. I can also find men attractive now. I'm too ashamed to tell anyone.","Hello, and thank you for reaching out to ask for help. Surely this is a very confusing time for you! If you have never had these
feelings and desires it could certainty shake everything you thought you knew
about yourself. 
My guess is that you becoming sick around the time that this
started is likely a coincidence, but I understand how you would make the
connection. 
I have a feeling that a few things may be going on here. It
is really hard to say since I don’t know you, how old you are, etc. But, I will
share you with you some thoughts. 
Some people, when they have undesirable thoughts that really
surprise them, have a really tough time getting rid of them. Our reaction to
the thought can be very strong and our tendency to try to block it out, stuff
it, avoid it, etc. is not always successful. In fact, it’s usually not. 
It’s like telling you not to think of pink elephants. I
would be willing to bet that you thought of a pink elephant just now. 
So, rather than fighting thoughts that you find confusing,
sometimes it is helpful to allow yourself to explore the thought with curiosity
and without judgement. Where is this thought coming from? What are my feelings
about it? Asking yourself these questions may help you come to a resolution
about what is going on. 
One possibility is that you have developed an anxiety about
your thoughts and now you are in the process of obsessing about them, but
another possibility is that you are legitimately exploring your sexuality and
gender. I get the feeling from your question that you do not want to believe
that it is second possibility. And that is okay. 
You can try some of my suggestions, but you can also see a
counselor who may be able to help you work through your confusion. I would
suggest someone who has experience working with sexuality issues. You can
usually find out what a counselor works with on their website. What is
important is that you find someone who is non-judgmental about what you are
experiencing. 
 
I wish you well.
Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC","The 3-days that you said you were feeling of sickness did not match what I know from experience that can occur because of a lot of stress and also that you had missed your sleep.  I can imagine some stress or things in your life that did not align for a long time, which can manifest into different symptoms. This could have come as a result of things that the symptoms you are experiencing aren’t necessarily symptoms of something serious. It is important to do more research on yourself as well as be understanding that many of us do not have our symptoms or behaviours as we think that we should. It's also important for you to consider that there are people you can come to terms with who can have similar symptoms, but they are more than likely to use certain medication to deal with them.   If you feel comfortable talking with someone that is familiar with what I have said, please reach out. Also talk to one of your friends or family who is trustworthy and who is supportive.I hope you can be positive about yourself."
"My stepdad and I always mess around. I've noticed that whenever he playfully hits me, it's always my butt that he hits. He always comments on my outfits and always scans me head to toe when I walk into a room. I'm a teenager female, and I want to know if this is normal.","It's hard to tell from the way you described it. Do you think he would be open to an honest discussion? It could be that his comments about your outfit are designed to make you feel good or to help them show how much he cares about you as his stepdaughter. As far as scanning you from head to toe, I can think of reasons that parents might do that. I also think that talking about it is probably very important so you really know what his intentions are. That way, it removes the guesswork and you have the opportunity to know what he is thinking and feeling and he can also know what your reactions are.","To figure out if this is normal and why this is happening, let's look at common reasons why boys hit their stepdad.
There are several possible reasons why a boy will hit his stepdad to get attention. At age 10 (or even younger), boys sometimes learn that hitting is a form of attention. This occurs in the case that the boy is not being listened to. Also, he may have already witnessed this behavior in his home and has not realized what is happening. If he does not know, he may be more likely to engage in this behavior to feel attention. Even if he doesn't know why, he may just have learned to hit because he was not corrected that his actions were not acceptable. One thing to note is that a boy who hits his stepdad does not have any control over his thoughts. His father does not want to get into arguments with his son, but his dad does not know how to correct his boy. The fact that he hits the stepdad is normal behavior, because he is trying to get attention from him. I don't know how to turn down his pleas for attention!"
"My mother has Alzheimer's and she has become so nasty and mean to everyone and she always asks for unrealistic, silly or meaningless items. I get so frustrated and angry, but then I feel guilty because I know it probably isn’t her fault. How can I cope with feeling like this?","It is challenging to see one's parents age and to cope with the new demands.  Your mom means a lot to you, and that is why you get easily frustrated.  I'm guessing that it is not that she is making you do work or that her expectations are non-important to you because if that were the case, you would not feel any guilt.  Accepting the new stage will help you cope with the changes.  Take a deep breath every time you feel frustrated and think of the good times you shared with your mom before her getting Alzheimer's.  Remember that your mom as she was is no longer and that she has reverted to a more delicate phase.  Also, schedule time for yourself and do things that help you relax.  Caretaking of an elderly parent can take a toll on you, and it is essential to incorporate self-care.  Finally, look for an Alzheimer's support group in your area that will help you connect with other people going through the same thing.  You are a good daughter, and your mom is lucky to have you in her life.Sincerely, Mirella~Image and Likeness Counseling","I really want to get you out of this vicious cycle of feeling guilty that you did something for your mom, and feeling bad for her. You are so busy and sad to deal with the guilt that you are forgetting that your mom is just a bit senil, so they're in pain but still in the moment. This is only a little bit of the reason behind her behavior, but don't blame yourself. It's something she's been dealing with in her life for many years. Sometimes all the anger from her is from dealing with pain from her life. I don't want to give you an answer because my reason for not giving you an answer is that I don't want to be irresponsible. I don't want you to feel guilty for not trying to figure out who is really causing it."
"I am a female, and I am afraid of having sex. I am afraid of disappointing my partner by being inexperienced. I think he thinks I'm not a virgin. I am also scared that he will be disappointed with my naked body. I don't want my partner to think differently of me because I am afraid of having sex.","These fears are completely normal. Almost everyone has the same fears you do, to some degree, especially if they lack experience. Men also feel far more of these fears than you realize. That can help...to remember that we're all a little scared and looking for safety and approval.You mention a partner, but I'm not sure if you currently have one. Having a partner you can trust with your fears and who you feel safe with is so important. When you're really confident someone cares deeply for you, this can help the fears to go away or diminish. How well do you know your own body? Getting to know how you like to be touched and how different touches feel...getting acquainted with your body yourself first...this can help build sexual confidence. In general, our partners care less about our fat and wrinkles than they care about how we make them feel in bed. Being a generous lover who is confident enough to put fear aside...ironically this is what makes you ""good in bed"". But be patient with yourself. Your confidence will grow with experience, and that doesn't have to happen until you are ready. There's not rush. :)","Hi! First off, thank you for sharing your vulnerability with me and I appreciate your willingness to work on this. It takes real courage to be this open about something you want to talk about. The fact that you've spent time thinking about this and exploring these thoughts about what your partner may think about your body, can be a great start. What would make you feel more comfortable in this area. What would make you feel more at peace and secure in your relationship? When you think about sex more than I do, you feel, as if it's you who is most important. I want you to know that pleasure and sexual satisfaction can be reached without sexual desire. You can experience pleasure just from cuddling, affection, being physically close to your partner, and through other activities like sharing a meal or taking a walk. Your partner might feel more like you are a virgin, and what he enjoys about you is that you like to feel completely open to his touch, and he may also feel a lot of satisfaction that you're excited about having pleasure with him. His pleasure comes from knowing that you're excited about having more sexual intimacy with him.  If you are having difficulty with pleasure, you can try reading some books on body awareness, such as *The Joy of Touch* by Emily Alexander, or *The Joy of Sex* by Dr. David Kaplan. Or you can search for ""sensual massage for men"" for more ideas. The point is to find how your body feels, and what you enjoy and the pleasure your partner can give. The idea that your partner thinks you're an inexperienced virgin is likely based on a lot of misunderstandings and myths. A virgin in this case is like the average person, and is not just one and the same. Your body is more than one and the same. You are still capable of great pleasure and satisfaction and you are beautiful, and you've got so much life to live and bring into the world! You are still young, and that means you have so much life ahead of you! Your body is a gift, and you deserve to be able to share it with whoever you want and enjoy it and be fully satisfied.  There is a lot of confusion about sex, and it is often a result of fear and not knowing what you want. You've mentioned that you are scared of disappointing"
"My husband and I got into a huge dispute. He said he wanted a divorce, and I left. I still come home a lot and see my kids, and he has not filed yet even though he still said he is. What does that mean for our marriage?","In any relationship, including marriage, each partner will be better able to do their part, by understanding their own interests and wishes.Concentrate more on what you'd like from your marriage.  This will naturally raise the questions and criteria of what to talk with your husband about and what to ask of him.Think over whether you wish to divorce or not.Since he hasn't taken any action, then for the moment, you can assume he is not sure of what he wants.Once you feel a little more clear on your opinion about your marriage, including feeling uncertain if you'd like it to end or continue, then you will be able to tell your husband the suggestions you have for resolving the dispute matter and emotions.Try to re-direct your speculations about, ""what does he want"", ""I wonder what he's thinking"", back to answering these very reasonable questions, about yourself.This will strengthen your own purpose in clarifying where to start and guide a discussion with him.Good luck!","I wish you the best! It is possible that he has simply been working on that problem for some time. Sometimes a marriage works even if one spouse is not working on it, because they simply do not care. If this is the case, that might be the only cause of him to be in so much distress.  If he is in such distress as to even be considering a divorce, we are also very in luck.  We can take some time for each of us, to get to know the other person better. However, it is important to note that before that, we have to decide whether we are more likely to keep the marriage going!&#x20;!"
"I've always thought that there wasn't much good out there for me. Now that things are actually going well, it kind of scares me. I spent most of my life feeling unwanted and figured I would be alone. I recently met a great woman who seems to really like me, and I don't know how to process this. It's bothering both of us.","You're in a lot of good company and it's great that you're in a positive relationship. Congratulations!I often hear people talk about loving yourself and self esteem. We often seem to blame ourselves for not ""loving ourselves"" enough or put ourselves down for having low self esteem. It seems to me that since we are essentially socially beings and in fact, need each other for our survival, we really know who we are through our many interactions with others and with our environment. In other words, you can't just snap your fingers and voila! now I love myself, where there was an empty space or self-doubt before. We grow that warm coal inside ourselves through the friction of contact with others who value and validate us.  Allow yourself to be patient with yourself as you experience this new relationship. You are learning a new model of who you are and how you fit into the world. What a marvelous gift for you! You may also have fears that the current joys may be temporary or unreliable. These fears of loss may get in your way, however understandable. If you are truly close to your companion, you can share with her that you are loving your relationship but sometimes fear it will go away and sometimes have trouble really trusting it. Such a conversation may bring you both closer. Hang in there. You're working on co-creating a new normal with a great woman.","Thank you for that wonderful person! You've always been lucky. That's the most important thing to remember. A lot of people just like the perfect version of themselves that they have all this time!  It sounds as though you are having trouble accepting that. Maybe you had a childhood where you never knew what it felt like to be accepted for who you are, a place where you were constantly bullied, made fun of or disliked. As you begin to see things and your self-esteem grows, your desire to find more people who like you, will be much more natural and less painful. You may find that even your mother or father are not your ""ideal"" people. It also doesn't mean that there's anything wrong with you. It just means there were things that people who liked you had you all the time in the past. People change. As such the love you want is not as powerful as the love you've always had, just because we have never had it that way before. You've given the people who loved you the best. That's wonderful. Maybe there are even people you've been told to not like. Love is a wonderful thing, and there are many people who love you. It's wonderful to know that you are loved by someone who likes you, and who will always love you. Now there is the lovely part – but this love exists in many forms. If the way you love yourself is not clear-cut to you, there are ways of knowing who you are.  A great starting point here would be to talk to your mother. It can be incredibly hard at first. Sometimes even speaking to your mother could mean more pain for you than you realize, or more clarity for you in the long run.  But in the end, maybe you'll realize what was missing for you all along. And, more than that, in the long run, your mother would much prefer you to be happy and happy to be with yourself than to be happy and stuck with someone who doesn't see you. Maybe your mother knows that you like her and has never let you know. She just doesn't know how to say that. If this is the case, then maybe you could talk to her about how you feel. The therapist may encourage you to ask your own questions and for help in determining what that would look like for you."
"Sometimes, I'm fine and can go out or meet people, but other days, my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth. I've always thought it was normal and I was just nervous, but the other day, it took me almost 30 minutes of sitting in my car to find the courage to enter Target by myself.","It is possible that you could have or be developing an anxiety disorder. There isn't really enough information provided here to suggest a particular disorder, but it might be worth meeting with a counselor or therapist to do a formal assessment. Some of the questions they might ask could be what other kinds of physical symptoms you experience, how frequently these physical symptoms happen, what's going on for you when they tend to happen, and how frequently/intensely you find yourself worrying in general. Anxiety itself is a really natural thing - it's just when it starts interfering with your ability to ""do life"" the way you want that we start to consider potential disorders. It might be that for the most part, the anxiety you feel is normal and you simply have some triggers that intensify it more than usual. Working on your own or with the support of a counselor/therapist to both address those triggers at the root and also to develop ways of managing the actual anxiety symptoms. This two-fold approach can be really helpful for not letting anxiety keep you from engaging in life the way you'd like.","It sounds like you are an example of how anxiety might impact the body's functions. I have read your previous posts about how anxiety might impact the body. It sounds like your body's physiological changes have made it difficult to communicate, for when you are in crisis mode.    It is not your fault, and I am sorry you experience this. It is not normal for the body to experience such a rush of physiological change.    It is important to remember that these rapid changes will go away. When you reach the panic phase and have no control over your body's response, this will not be helpful."
"Everyone around me is much smarter and flaunts it. Everyone around me is skinny, and here I am trying to throw up so I'm not fat. Everything I do is wrong, and I can't seem to do anything right! No one else at school seems to feel the way I do! Is this normal teenage girls feelings? I don't think these feelings are normal.","There are some struggles that are less ""obvious"" than others, an eating disorder being one of them. From just your personal experience alone you might realize how easy it may seem to keep such a secret from those around you. In the same way, there are many people who struggle secretly with this problem and not many people know or even notice. So you are definitely not alone. Low self-esteem or lack of confidence in some areas are issues that EVERY teen, in fact EVERY person, has experienced at some point. These feelings are ""normal."" It sounds, though, as if these feelings of insecurity and inadequacy have begun to consume your every day thoughts and behaviors bringing you to where you are today - comparing yourself to others, purging, and feeling extreme guilt. Sometimes it's best if we seek outside help, instead of trying to tackle problems on our own. Breaking habits that come along with an eating disorder really requires the help of a doctor, nutritionist, and a therapist who can help change your perspective from the inside out! Hope this helps!",1.  You should consult the professional guidance of the school counselor so that you get advice for dealing with school bullying.
Now I have anger and trust issues. How can I treat this and fix myself?,"I will assume that for whatever reason, you either do not want to or are not able to seek counseling for this. However, I highly urge you to do so because long-term childhood abuse does have negative consequences for your life as an adult, as it seems you are already aware. There are confidential and free crisis hotlines that you can call that deal with sexual abuse. Some/most also offer free counseling services in local areas. That would be a good place to start looking, especially if cost of counseling is an issue.The important thing to know is that what happened was not your fault and that you deserve to live a happy life free of the past. Having anger and trust issues after something like this is a perfectly normal reaction to what happened to you. Angry? Yes! At your brother for what he did, at your parents for not protecting you. Having trouble trusting? Of course! The very people who were supposed to love and protect you hurt you instead. Two books that might help you are Codependent No More and Boundaries: Where You End and I Begin.","Anger can be a very complex emotion.  If you don't know what is causing your anger then you may also have something to address that is not directly related to anger, but you may have a deeper level of challenge that you are struggling with. I know you mentioned the anger and trust issues. If you have a partner or spouse that you do not trust, you may be able to try and repair the relationship or separate your lives in the future. I would suggest you talk with a therapist about your trust issues and anger issues to help you address the root of the problems as well as create positive, balanced relationships."
I have this weird fetish that I'm afraid to open up about it. What should I do?,"This is difficult to answer because you don’t tell us what the fetish is.  I do understand that this is something that is bothering you though. The first thing to ask yourself is if this is something that is illegal or not.  If this is illegal to engage in, then you need to seek counseling help immediately to control the urges.However, if your fetish is not something illegal and you just feel that it is something odd, a therapist could still help you deal with these feelings.  You may find that it is something very common and not something to be ashamed of.  You may find other people have the same interest as you.  Find a therapist that you can trust and tell them.  Don’t hold back with your therapist.  Trust me, they have heard and seen it all by now, and they can help you either stop the behavior that is causing you distress, or help you come to terms with accepting the behavior as part of who you are.  There is no need to suffer with this alone.",I’m sorry to hear you've got this fantasy that's holding you back from being more open with people. I'm happy to help guide you through a better plan to make your fantasy more real.
"I want a secure relationship with someone that wants to be with me and who will actually put effort into it.
 I seem to gravitate toward unavailable men and those that want intimacy and no relationship. I let men dictate and control me because they accuse me of being controlling. I let men emotionally abuse me and I am at their beck and call.
 I am not comfortable being alone or doing anything by myself. I feel I need the security of someone being around just to survive. I know what I'm doing wrong and I do it anyway just hoping things will change.

In it I offer 7 expert tips to help you get started on a path of self connection and discovery. This is important stuff to do in order to work through that stuff that's holding you back from the relationships you desire. You may find that it's especially helpful to do this work with the alliance of a skilled individual therapist.","I'm sorry to hear about your struggle with this. At the moment, there is nothing to do and only one thing to do: work on your own thought process and get over the attachment/dependency to wanting someone in your life and wanting someone to hold your hand to you as you go through life. You are looking for someone who wants to be with you and not take control of it, you want someone who shows you that they care for you. I would suggest you start with some simple self-help. I am sorry you feel helpless, but there is not much you can do that you can't control.  There is something you can control though: What you do with the attention and energy you give to someone else.  What you do with the things that are most important to you, such as your relationships.  You don't need them to be around to make the same emotional, mental and physical relationship out of you.  You choose the intimacy and responsibility.  I hope this helps!"
"My friend’s husband is bipolar and refuses to take medication for it. He has taken the wheels off her vehicle before to prevent her from leaving. He has held her a prisoner in her home. He has choked her, hit her, etc. She has almost divorced him a couple of times but always makes up with him, thinking that he is going to change. She and I went to a wedding out of town in September of 2014, and ever since she has been back, he is convinced that she cheated on him while we were gone. Now he is saying that I have also cheated on my boyfriend and has come to my house and told my boyfriend this.","I’m glad that you  are seeking help and that you are supporting your friend. I’m sure this is all overwhelming and frustrating for you. The biggest thing you can do for your friend is to be supportive as you are already doing. Unfortunately there isn’t much you can do for her outside of that because it is up to her husband to change and up to your friend if she wants to leave. There are things you can do to support more: it might be helpful for her to have some information on a domestic violence non profit in her area because they can assist her in many areas if she wants to leave. They can also provide you with support while you go through this with her. The nonprofit can also safety plan with her and it might be helpful for you to do it with her if you want to. Another thing you can do is support her in decision to stay with her husband or not despite what she decides. Many victims decide to stay with thier abusive partner for many reasons. It is important to support her decisions, even if you don’t agree with them, because she may have very little decision making in her relationship. I would also encourage you to make sure you are taking care of yourself while you support her so you are not becoming too overwhelmed. Here is some info that might be helpful to you. https://abuseintervention.org/sandbox77/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/How-to-Help-a-Loved-One.pdf","Do you not understand that she could be hurting you through her actions toward you.

Is the expression of love for you true, or can you recognize if she's acting out of anger? The second reason I'd ask a question that's more appropriate is to give an understanding of when the emotion has gone out of control and it's time to give her a break. It seems like she's talking about you to someone else, which is the first step in your healing, and is something that only you should know who to speak to when you're feeling sad and lonely. Also, it sounds like there may be something else going on. Since you're not in touch for a long period of time, and you've had many arguments, you are likely going to experience another form of sadness, possibly an emotional one. In your work with me and other therapists, you will learn how to deal with this sadness while you have the first contact with others. You don't have to do all of this to your ex, and you don't have to go to therapy, because it might not even help! Since your work here is to help yourself become a better version of yourself, you must be well within your own power to deal with anything that is causing you to feel this way. I'd be happy to help you, and it is probably possible. You are an adult. So you have the right to be alone with you and the right to decide what you want to do with yourself. Is there something you wish you had done differently in your time together? If it's the same, you're going to learn more about yourself in the next 4 weeks."
"When I get frustrated or upset, it becomes extremely difficult to keep my voice down. I also instantly cry and tend to have anxiety attacks. What can I do to try and control it?","I'm going to reframe this and you can decide if this is helpful!What I'm reading based on what you gave is that you are actually doing your best to manage intense feelings of internal dysregulation.  Anger is something that is generally a protective emotion that quickly arises to keep us safe in some way, whether or not the situation is truly a threat.  The part of our brain that perceives this is not controllable to us, so we don't get to decide what emotion(s) we respond with.It does also sound like you are experiencing some significant anxiety, maybe even underlying the anger?  Without knowing the context, it's hard to say what would help on an individual level but working through those triggers and what is really influencing them deep down could be beneficial.  There's many different ways to do that in therapy if you so choose that as your path.If you do decide to see a therapist, most will tell you that the goal is not necessarily to control your anxiety or anger.  Sometimes there's a strong set of beliefs that, when activated, are catalysts to strong emotions that influence behavior.  Trying to control an emotion on its own is usually unsuccessful for people because it leaves out all the other powerful elements at play.  Emotions are information and the brain sends that information out because it believes we need it at that time.  Therapists can help unravel that with you in whatever way you need, whether that's with somatic work, work at the level of belief (or schemas), or otherwise---hitting it at these deeper layers can unpair and/or decrease emotional responses.  It all takes work and time, so don't get down on yourself if the process is complicated or slower than you expected or hoped for.What we know though is that the brain is very capable of change (even if it's painful).   Hope this gives you a helpful place to start from!",So you've identified some things that are making you struggle. That is the first step for moving forwards with healing. Here are a few things that may be affecting you in this way: 1. Try to identify with a calming color. 2. Try a mindful breathing exercise. 3. Try a relaxation technique like progressive muscle relaxation. 4. Find someone who understands and can help you understand your emotional triggers. 5. Try to work with a therapist who is trained in trauma and anxiety.You know there may be underlying reasons for what you do and for how you react to things in your life. Let's work together to address these issues.
"I have been dating my boyfriend for eight years. We met in college off away from home and things went from good to bad when I met his family who treats him like he is their man. They expect him to take them on dates like to the movies and out to eat when they come around, and he thinks it's okay.","Well, then you learned something new about your boyfriend!Are you fine with having a different opinion than him and staying together.Think over how major a problem this is to you and if it is reason enough to leave the relationship.There are always plenty of areas of disagreement between partners in a relationship.The key to being happy is to know which ones you can accept and which ones are beyond your tolerance with which to live.Also, an early step would be to directly tell your boyfriend your opinion.   He may be willing to change his ways to satisfy you.","I'm sorry to hear that your boyfriend is not willing to treat you well. Is his family able to be considerate of you, such as to take you out on a date or to show up when you want them to? Is his family and girlfriend's dynamic healthy, or does your boyfriend have the ability to see that? Is there something else that your boyfriend thinks he should see about his family/girlfriend, and how does it reflect in a healthy way?"
"For my whole life, I’ve been very unconfident, insecure, and self-questioning. I'm super quiet because I'm scared of what people will think of me. I avoid all social situations as it causes me great anxiety. It is how both of my parents have always been, and I feel like I'm doomed to that life also. It makes it super hard for me at work as the other employees try to use me and walk all over me because I’m too nice. It causes me depression and brings me down. I’m in my early twenties, and I really need to create a better life for myself. I've been like this for so long, so how do I change?","One of the greatest ways that we can promote ourselves s by learning how to assert ourselves.  Despite what most people think of when they hear the word assertive, assertive communication is one of the best ways to manage interpersonal conflict as well as maintain personal boundaries.  Once we become comfortable with acknowledging our boundaries, there is usually a follow-up whereby we realize that we have the right to those boundaries.  In effect, assertiveness communication becomes it's own self-motivating force in managing positive self-esteem. You may want to invest in a workbook that can help you to develop these skills on your own, or work directly with a therapist to develop them in a safe situation.   One of the Workbooks that I have found to be very helpful is, ""The Assertiveness Workbook: How to Express your Ideas and Stand Up for Yourself at Work and in Relationships"" by Randy J Paterson.","First, be kind to yourself. Sometimes a person's self-hatred and self-doubt are built into that person. You will have to start by slowly removing those ideas so that you can see yourself the way you think you're supposed to look (or act in the world). To do this, you need to start by telling yourself what you are proud of. You are a really interesting person, it is wonderful you have been able to find others who appreciate you. I know this is difficult to do, but you need to get a handle on how this part of you feels. By taking time to see yourself the way you think you are (and I'm writing this from a place of empathy and understanding), you're starting to break free from the prison that this voice inside you has created. Start by telling yourself 3 good things about the person you are. Repeat that statement over and over again so you remember the good things you are, and it can help you to feel more confident. You could start by trying to identify the thoughts that are telling you things you like about yourself. The first and most important question is ""Why do I think that?"" Once you ask that, you will likely find out the actual reason why you think that. And then, you can change that thought and see how it might affect your life. Sometimes, the answer to it is in the fact that you are a person who is happy and is aware of who you are. If you are truly happy, then you can accept yourself who you are. You may discover that as you get older, as you become more free from your own self-doubt, you'll realize that that particular voice inside you isn't always right and isn't always useful. You’ll learn that it is far more productive to listen to your intuition and what your gut tells you. So, this is all a process of learning. When you become more confident in your ability to be happy, you will come to know that it's okay to be who you are. It is okay to say ""no"" to people or situations that are harmful, that you don't want, or that drain your energy. You're entitled to say ""no"". It's good to learn this, because it's a skill you have to work on"
"My depression has been reoccurring for a long time. It all started when I was being bullied in high school. In ninth grade, my principal told me I needed to stay home for a couple days to protect myself while she spoke to my classmates. I needed professional help for my stress because I was having crying spells from the stress of going to school and confronting my classmates. After that, I was fine for a couple of years. I entered my first year of college in a really tough program with high demands of expected work. I believe my depression re-booted from there with the stress. I began to cut myself because a friend of mine at the time told me how she used to do the same and it used to feel good for her. Obviously, that wasn't the right choice. I regret ever doing that, seeing as even though I'm not self-harming anymore, I always look back at that time whenever I feel very stressed. I have a big problem with handling problems in life. Whenever a problem arises, I get stressed and I feel hopeless, as if it's not going to get better. I get way too stressed from my problems, which leads to overreacting a lot (especially when talking to others), which then leads to depression. I have a hard time coping with stress because I know that if I could handle it easily then I wouldn't be sad all the time, and I would say and do the right thing instead of overreacting to my loved ones.","I couldn't help but notice that you did not specify your age, so I am unable to set the total chronological order and length that you have suffered in this way, but I want to start by commending you on seeking out additional coping techniques on your own.  Unfortunately, it sounds like you were offered some that were more dangerous than helpful, but be proud that you were able to curb those before they caused too much harm. From what you have written, stress has always been a difficult thing for you to manage.  Often, when I am working with those who offer the same concern, there is a degree of people pleasing that comes with that stress.  When we are trying to make others happy, especially when we are unable to distinguish the proper ""rules for success"", it can make even the simplest of tasks overwhelming. Stress management is just that, management; of our own anxieties about the needs of others, about our skills and the ability to complete a task and having multiple requests at any given time. Each of these aspects requires a separate sets of ""tools"" to manage them accordingly. For example, assertiveness communication training could aid in communicating with your colleagues to manage their expectations of your deadlines and abilities, but it will not assist you with managing your own anxieties. Try to separate the different areas of the problem, in order to help yourself to find a solution and work on them in their own time. Perhaps keeping a journal will help you to better understand why you are so easily overwhelmed by stress and help you track some of your less-helpful responses to stress. For example, does a certain person's style of communication always make you feel undervalued and therefore push you to finish their requests first? Is there a certain time of the day where you start to fall off in productivity?  Is that the time fo the day where you also tend to pile up your requirements?Try to ask yourself some of these harder questions and see where they lead you.","You are on the right track with your desire to understand what your depression has changed for you. While high school experiences and bullying have a significant impact on mental health in the teenage years, this doesn't explain depression. Depressive symptoms can develop over many years.

The fact that you always look back at that period and find that you are at the beginning of a long pattern of depression that had started in high school, and that you started cutting yourself when you were stressed is a very good observation!  This sounds like you are having a lot of trouble with your life.  It is only natural to feel down about the things that have been going on in your life. What you need is to look at how much you are controlling your life and what that control really looks like. Are you truly in control of your feelings? Are you using those feelings to influence your life in a positive way? If not, there are lots of ways to get the feeling of control you need. It might be through learning more about yourself and your triggers, helping you learn to cope with stress in a healthy way, working on relationship skills, or, in some cases, seeking additional help.  I wish you the best of luck as you start this journey of self-discovery and find your way to feeling more calm and in control of your life."
"Or how to send him somewhere that can help him, something like The Baker Act.","More information would be needed for me to accurately answer this question, such as your age, whether you live with your dad or not, and what other family members live in the household. Something like this, alcoholism, is a whole family disease. In other words, family members often unknowingly contribute to the alcoholism and enable the alcoholic to continue the destructive behavior.First of all, you can’t make your dad do anything, and constantly nagging him or begging him to stop is just going to make him defensive and make this worse. Nobody can change another person. What you can do is change how you react to him and the things that you and other family members do for him. Research codependency. There’s a great book called Codependent No More. There are a lot of articles on the internet that you can read. In short, you have to stop enabling him. Like I said, you cannot control him, but you can control yourself. This means do not buy his alcohol. Do not make it easy for him to get. Don’t loan him the car keys or pay any household bills for him. Don’t call in sick to work for him or make excuses for him in any way. Do not bail him out of jail when he gets arrested. He needs to be responsible for himself. This may mean losing his job or losing his driver’s license. This may mean that he loses his family if he doesn’t stop. What you and your family can do is set boundaries about what you will put up with. It is his choice to drink, but it is your choice to put up with the behaviors of his drinking. A lot of people go into rehab because their spouse said if they don’t then they are getting a divorce.If you are an adult and you don’t live with your dad, then the best thing you can do for him is STOP doing things for him. If you are a child who lives at home with him, then this could be a case for child protective services. In my state this is called DHS. A report is made to this organization for child abuse or neglect. Substance abuse in the home qualifies. Of course, alcohol is legal and when consumed in moderation, there is no problems. The problem will be the result of his alcohol consumption. Does he drive with children in the car while intoxicated? Is he left to care for minors while in an intoxicated state? Are there any domestic violence issues due to his drinking? This could be a reason for the authorities to step in. You can look for a local meeting for family members of alcoholics. They are similar to the AA meetings that an alcoholic should go to, but are for the family members. They can help you.","I need your help. You are a therapist and you have no help. I am a friend and I want you to be there for me so I do not become trapped in my own issues. I am very afraid that I have something like the Baker Act so that I can be taken to court.  Because I have a problem that has been going on for a few years, it has been a huge factor in the breakdown of my marriage  My spouse and I have fought a lot, and in the end there are some that leave us,  because of how much the other person has been hurt by the other's past. I have been hurt on many occasions as well. My spouse and I are both just  people trying to get a job and to have a healthy family. I had to stay together for a long time after we were in the divorce and I would do it again, but I still worry about where we are now. Because I see it in myself as a pattern of not wanting to give up what I've got.  And with my spouse, I know that I can't stay with him because I don't think I can give him the love he needs.I do not need to get the help I do not need. I am afraid of how you'd react to me. I've tried counseling before, and I am not sure what I need. I don't know how to be happy or not unhappy. I don't know if I am a good wife or a good wife. I am not sure if I will ever get this marriage back together."
I believe it is wrong for men to look at inappropriate content. The father of my child has agreed to respect my beliefs. His co-worker sent him an inappropriate video. He got mad because he does not think he should tell his friend to not send him things like that.,"It sounds like you are wanting to protect your child from degrading images and that is one of the important parts of the job of a parent. Although it is challenging to supply an answer without knowing the full situation, it might be helpful to have a more broad discussion about what you both think about the influences and images that your child is exposed to and what you think your role is in protecting your child. This situation is one about beliefs and values and could well be an example you can use for exploring your parenting roles in protecting your child.","It seems your co-worker has not understood that he has the right to decide what he sends to his friends, and to know he should not be given the right to know what his friend is sending him. Even though the video was inappropriate, your child's father might be open to discussing the topic of how inappropriate these types of situations are and how a healthy parent might try to decide what is appropriate for their child. The co-worker seems to have taken this task, and then decided his friend was not trustworthy enough to trust him, making this situation seem very difficult."
"I'm a teenager. I get random spurts of anger, like complete, pure rage. I figured it was hormones, but others notice it too. I get self-destructive. I used to cut but stopped. Now when I get mad, I bite my arms and fingers, pull my hair, scratch my face, or punch my thighs. Basically, I do things I can hide instead of breaking anything in my room and having to explain it to my mom. I don't live in a bad household. I have a great family, a great relationship with my boyfriend, and a good job. I have no idea what this is and I don't know how to control it. It's over any little thing. Tonight, it was because I couldn't get my earrings out. This happens maybe two to three times on a good week, and it's always over stupid, petty things.","Hi. I'm glad you wrote. In general, when a small thing bothers us (and this happens to all of us), it's because the small thing triggers an emotion in us that we have felt ""too much"" or ""too intensely"" in the past, and we don't know how to manage that emotion effectively...we just want to avoid it as quickly as possible. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy with a qualified therapist can help you to understand what is being triggered in you and learn how to manage emotions productively. You say that your behaviours are self destructive, and I agree. It sounds like you have developed a habit of channelling your distress towards self-harm, and this is a separate and potentially more serious problem. This is a choice you make that points to shame being an issue for you. Again, a good therapist can help you learn what's behind your shame and self-harm. Your feelings are normal, and you can learn more healthy ways to deal with them with qualified help.","Hi! It would be great to know some more about this person and their situation. I am a licensed therapist with expertise in trauma and mental health. I am interested in hearing more about the emotions you describe, as these are a big part of mental health treatment. You want to talk to yourself when you have anger, and want to stop it. It's really great that you noticed this part about your reactions. Because you do not want to harm yourself or others, this is all important and you need to calm down before things become more chaotic. When I have anger, I go to the edge of my anger, and try to go to the calm center of my self.  It is hard to learn to live with anger because you will feel yourself more and more and more angry. Anger is not always a bad feeling, just is it well-controlled. I have one client with a really intense, anger response and really little control.  They feel like they have no good things to say about themselves, so they use to go into it and cut themselves.  They would spend hours in the bathroom with their hands cut as they got angry, it's sad because they are hurting themselves, and their anger is really bad. Also, they say that they don't feel in control and it makes them feel helpless.  One of the goals of therapy is to help people find out what helps them with their anger and to learn to stop the anger in the first place. When people learn to stop the anger and think of all the things they have to be grateful for, things start to change. How about I help you talk about some people you know who have had some success with anger management, and you can talk about them and see if you can learn something from them, like what that other person has learned about learning to calm down, or how they are able to stay calm."
I get very nervous and anxious/scared before sex.,"I first wonder what your anxiety or fear connects to. I don't know whether it is about sex itself or about ideas of worthiness or feeling desirable.There is also a difference between having self-doubt about the actual physicality of having sex (performance-related) or having doubts about whether you want to have sex with a particular person.Having sex can lead to feelings of great vulnerability. If your partner is someone you trust, consider discussing what it is that comes up for you around the issue of sex. This is the certain things that your partner would be willing to do that and the ease your discomfort, like staying with you for some time before and after sexual interactions.Another idea to consider is spending time with your partner and using nonsexual touch for each other (perhaps first you to him and then him to you) and communicating very clearly about what you like and do not like. Some people like to be spoken to during physical touch and other people do not. All of this can be part of your discussions. When you feel comfortable with that, you could move into sexual touch in this manner and actually look at what you do and do not like. You may also consider discussing things that are totally off-limits for you all the time and things for which you would like warning or awareness before they happen. There are really a number of different ways to work on becoming more comfortable if you trust your partner and if your concern is about sex itself.If this feels pretty structured, it is initially. Generally, the idea is to learn more about each other and yourselves and then the process becomes much more natural.If the concern relates more to self-esteem related sex, consider asking your partner to list several things that he or she likes about you. Even if you don't necessarily see yourself in the same light, consider that this is how your partner sees you, so these are some of the things that make you attractive to them (perhaps both in sexual ways and in a wider discussion of the relationship).If this is difficult for you to sort out on your own, consider seeing a therapist with experience working with couples or relationships.","Hi [Your name], it's understandable that you want to get over this fear; it is something to work with and be worked through.   As well as anxiety, are there any other feelings that come up before you are feeling comfortable with your body? Sometimes these feelings are also associated with other anxieties and fears.   You could explore the other parts of your life to understand them better and how that impacts your sexual being.  This could be the love of your partner, the relationships you have with friends, and so on.   I wish you the best."
"My husband told me last year he never loved me and should have never married me. He's been talking about divorce, but he hasn't filed. Now he has a girlfriend and he abandoned me and his kids. He has no financial help, and he has been out of the home for four months. He became very angry and mean. He says it's all my fault, and that we're not compatible.",It's hard to say that it is a midlife crisis stage..  could be... but so much more seems to be going on or have been going on to say with confidence that it is not much more.,"It sounds like all of the work you've been doing is a pretty huge amount of work, and is really likely to be of no use in your case. If you have a partner who is threatening to end the relationship for a reason, it is wise for you to look at your legal options. Some countries have more lenient rules in this respect than others, and you may have the chance to get money back if you agree to go through divorce. It will also be beneficial to see a lawyer, who can advise you on what is best in your area."
I easily recognize this but have no control over it and need suggestions for managing my anger.,"I suggest that you work on emotional awareness. Emotional awareness basically means knowing what you are feeling and why.Emotional awareness also means that you can identify the link between the way you are feeling and your actions. In other words knowing that your feelings dictate what you do.Often feelings of hurt or insecurity can come out as anger if we cannot properly identify and express the feelings.Being emotionally aware also means that you are able to express your feelings to others. Being unable to do so leads to feelings of frustration and being misunderstood.Many people for many different reasons are not in touch with their emotions. For example, men traditionally have been brought up taught to not express sadness or weakness. Therefore, many men learned to turn feelings of sadness, insecurities, or fears into anger and express these feelings as anger. Being taught not to feel a certain emotion does not make that emotion disappear. Instead it makes us learn how to express it in other, incorrect, ways. If a man never learns to say “I am sad” or “that really hurt my feelings” and instead lashes out in anger, then the response they get from those around them will be to the anger and not a response to the underlying true feeling, which will leave the man feeling alone and misunderstood.You can control yourself and not explode. Walk away, remove yourself from the situation, do whatever you have to do to not lash out. Instead of reacting the way you normally would, go somewhere by yourself and think about what just happened and try to understand why such a “simple” thing upset you. What is the real feeling driving these outbursts? Maybe you can begin to recognize an underlying pattern. It might help to keep an anger journal. Write down everything that gets you upset. That might help you see a pattern and pinpoint what may be setting you off. Talking with a therapist about this would be beneficial in helping pinpoint the underlying cause of the outbursts you are experience.","I'm happy to help you think about managing your anger. If you find yourself reacting negatively and in ways that seem out of your control, which may include verbal abuse or aggressive behaviors, it is also important to seek help from a therapist to get a proper diagnosis and to work through the root causes. There are other ways to feel angry, some people do not have control over their anger, as others do."
"Two years ago, I was separated from the military into my contract for medical issues. It has emotionally destroyed me. I now basically hate myself. It's embarrassing to be separated from the one place who takes anyone. My family has been in the armed forces, and it has always been my dream. I can't do this alone anymore, and now my family is even worried.","It sounds like being separated from the armed forces is a major loss for you. It takes some time to work through the emotions related to this and it often takes longer if you are trying to work through it without a lot of support.Is there a task that you were doing during your military service that can in some way transfer into civilian life? I don't know what else your life involves, whether you have close friends or a romantic partner, a career, activities that you like to do, and many other things. You may be able to use some of the things that you still have today as a way to start moving forward in a different direction.Your military service will always be a part of you. Thank you for your service.","This sounds like a great place to find emotional support from the military and family. Being separated from the military is a very difficult experience.  My first instinct would be to ask the user what their family, and/or the military knows or thinks about the user's situation and feelings.   I also would mention the importance of family support, from friends or support groups, as well as those within the military family unit. I would recommend that they find the support they need by either being able to use the medical resources offered by the military, or by reaching out to professional counselors in a way that is best suited for them."
All we do is argue. We never agree on anything.,"Simply, Yes!Just because you argue, does not mean your marriage is not worth it. Couples disagree. They are different people from different worlds with different likes and dislikes. Trying to mesh these different worlds is tough, but does not mean you don’t need to not be married.There are reasons why couples don’t get along. Finding out why you cannot compromise and working towards similar goals can help. Talking about what you really want out of the marriage and relationship may show y’all how much your relationship goals are similar. Then you can build upon that.Learning communication skills, listening skills and ways to improve your ability to express self without anger can help.","The question is simply about the nature of relationships in our culture, not about you being wrong to like your partner. Whether a couple agrees on everything is not your responsibility.  For most people, the most important thing is that you have a relationship that you enjoy.  If there are challenges, then you might need to talk about them. If you're both willing to work on it, then that will only make things better.  Whether you are still in love with your partner depends on whether you have found a relationship that has become more love than attraction.   Most relationships do not last forever.  If you do not like you're partner, then that is something that you need to address, whether you are with the person you're in love with or not.  Your love and interest in each other is more important than anything else, so you can address them.  It can be good for your individual relationship as well as your relationship with your partner to have some time apart, and then when you're both ready you can get back together.  If you're not ready or aren't still interested in your partner, then you must consider your own needs."
"I started dating a guy I met online. He told me that he registered sex offender but he didn't do anything. He took a plea to always register as sex offender and he did two years. That was more than two decades ago. Nothing on his record since. I always believe the past should be left in past. But my roommates, their family and my son are unforgiving. Should I forgive this man that I'm falling in love with or should I dump him? If I stay with him I will never see my family and granddaughter again.","Thank you for your question. Trust is a huge thing in relationships and when that is broken, or perceived as being broken, it takes a long time to repair. From what you shared, it sounds like your boyfriend took steps to correct the situation and has shown to be trustworthy since. Unfortunately, no matter how much we apologize for something we did or for something others perceive we did, there will always be those with hardened hearts and will not forgive. If you feel confident in your relationship, then trust your inner wisdom. We cannot control others but only ourselves. Respect your families wishes to remain in unforgiveness while at the same time, ask them to respect your wish to believe in him and be in this relationship. Good luck to you.","I’m so sorry your roommates and your family want to see you go. I want to say that these were not your decision to make. You made a decision that, while maybe not the best one, was one that you made anyway and had to live with.  Sex offender registrations are often illegal and have serious ramifications. Your parents are good people. I hope your sister in law could be a friend of hers. Hopefully she knows the details and could give me advice.  It's up to you to make the decision about whether you forgive and whether you'll find any chance for change, or you decide to move on. I wish you all the best."
"I have three children: a biological daughter, a stepdaughter, and a stepson. I found out my stepdaughter overdosed today. My daughter blames me. I told her to stay out of it. I'm scared of all three kids now. They all blame me for their choices they made. All three have drug addictions. I had a stroke in 2013 so I need to depend on people from now on.","Blaming others is one of our greatest coping mechanisms.  It is not just for addiction, and often we blame the ones closest to us.  You can not stop them from blaming you, you can stop yourself for taking on the burden.  We are all in charge of the choices we make.  No one makes us do something other than our self.  We choose how we internalize and react to situations.  I would find a good therapist who understands family dynamics and addiction to help you cope with your current environment and help you move forward.","My heart is aching for you and knowing you have three children. You have to get out of the house; it's your chance to protect your self from this and get back to some peace. I will never forget your daughter’s grief and how many other adults have felt the loss of a child. You can help your daughter understand that you love her. You can teach her that it is not possible to please and love the same child at the same time. Not every adult is a therapist, and you don't need to be one. Do not tell them to stop blaming you. That is not going to work. I will always be here to hold your hand through this. Do not make too many promises, you are not a doctor and you do not have a degree of medical expertise. The truth is you are in the middle of your own life and that's all you can be in charge of right now. I would not be able to do this for anyone else. But please know that you can't please everyone. I wish you all the best. I can't understand what you went through or why it happened to you and/or your family members. I feel so sorry for you and for those who must deal with this now."
"My daughter didn't see her biological father for the last three years. She doesn’t want to see him because she remember really bad things from him such as domestic violence and child abuse. The visitation is with supervision, but she refuses to see him. Is it better to take my daughter to the therapist and try to see him after the therapy?","Hi Dillon,I'm from Canada, so I don't know the laws in your state. It depends on that a good deal, perhaps. In my opinion, a child should never be forced into a situation where they feel unsafe, even if it is ""supervised"". If the child is old enough to make a strong statement about not wanting to see a parent, then this should be honoured. Unfortunately, the laws don't always uphold a parent's right to do what is best for their child. I recommend you see a lawyer, who will advise you about how to proceed without putting yourself at risk of breaching custody agreements.If you feel your daughter can benefit from therapy, that is a separate question. Or is she already in therapy? A family therapist will typically meet with you alone first, in order to determine if therapy is a wise move for your child. It isn't always appropriate.","First the support he provides to both you and your daughter. As a parent in this situation, she has been given the support to allow both you and your daughter the space to grow together and to have their own relationship. You already have her in your care. It seems like a good idea to talk with both the therapist and your daughter and work together on what the best way to proceed looks like for both of you."
"I've been hospitalized twice. Once was last month for psychiatric help. I'm on medicine, but I'm struggling with fighting the negative thoughts, irrational fears, and loneliness. The people around me aren't helping much.","If you are someone who usually has a job, pays or contributes to household bills, and generally manages your own daily life, then here are some suggestions.Start with small changes in your life so that you will feel successful in developing little areas of personal happiness.Since the people whom you currently are in your life ""aren't helping much"", consider branching out your life so that you are with those with whom you do feel help you.Follow your natural interests.  If you like reading, look online for a local book club.   If you like watching birds, look up a bird watching group.Social isolation increases the intensity of negative feelings.Also, the way healthcare is set up in the US, psychiatrists spend 15 minutes asking a person questions and then giving them a pill script.    There is almost no human interest in the person.If you'd like feeling better as a person, then find people.   Relying only on our mental health system will keep you feeling low and unsteady.If your life is a little more sheltered and you are in a group home setting or your basic needs are taken care of by someone or some organization, then similar advice is still valid.Find and participate in whatever human settings which appeal to you and are available on a somewhat regular basis.","You are being held hostage by your own mind.  You have a deep desire to seek help.  You're already in treatment.  Now, the struggle is to get help *out* of this place that only you can control. It would be a little helpful to work with a therapist who is able to help guide you to a better mental space. I am not a therapist, but I know the signs.  It will be very interesting to discuss your situation with a human being and see if we can work through it together. If you were to seek out a therapist you could learn about the most common way people have a hard time getting help.  They might be so worried about what others think, they may be afraid to do so. So, you may want to seek out a therapist who is focused on helping people with anxiety and/or depression. This therapist would probably help you determine what is in your mind to keep you trapped.  I strongly suggest you discuss your concerns with a mental health professional.  They are qualified in this area and can help guide you toward a healing pathway."
I need to speak to someone about sexual addiction and binge eating immediately.,"There is an organization dedicated to helping individuals find affordable counseling.  It is called Open Path Collective.  There is a one time membership fee of $49 and it lasts for your lifetime.  You then have access to local counselors/therapists who will see you for an extremely reduced rate, anywhere from $30 - $60.   https://openpathcollective.org/","I would not be able to understand what sexual addiction and binge eating is or what would be a good place to start talking with somebody about this. I would recommend you see a therapist who specializes in treatment of these issues, someone who can be helpful in both the treatment of Sexual Addiction and the issues of binge eating."
"I've been in a relationship for almost a year, and I absolutely trust my boyfriend. He treats me nice, checks on me, and tells me sweet things. However, when it comes to making life decisions, I feel he is very immature. I try to talk things out so we can compromise or make sound decisions together, but he lacks any ideas and prefers to just go with anything to avoid fighting. As far as dates, if I don't say anything, plan it, or have money to chip in, we will not go. I feel like I put in a lot of work supporting and sometimes spoiling, and all I get is a loyal man who will not cheat and say sweet things on occasion.","Well, then your decision is whether you want to stay in this type of relationship or not.One point to keep in mind is this.Just because he's not telling you his opinions doesn't mean he doesn't have any opinions.In the long run t is always easier to talk with someone about their differences from our point of view than to be someone who doesn't tell you what is in their mind.Short term it seems easy to have someone agreeable.Long term someone who doesn't tell you their thoughts and who disagrees with you, may potentially go about their true wishes in hidden ways.","Hi, what is this question?"
"I was raped by multiple men, and now I can't stand the sight of myself. I wear lingerie to get my self excited enough to have sex with my wife.","I am very sorry to hear about your rapes.  Traumatic events, such as rape, can have some lasting effects.  Issues with sex drive are one of these effects.  Therapy can help to decrease the impact that traumatic events have upon our lives as we process through some of our experiences.   EMDR can be a particularly effective modality of treatment to address this issues.  I would also encourage you to have an honest conversation with your wife about this concern.  Sometimes it is helpful to have that conversation with a therapist so that the therapist can help educate  your wife in regards to effects of trauma.  This may help her understand that your feelings are more about the trauma and less about her as a person.  Best of luck to you!","Hi! I'm glad you are feeling excited to have sex with your wife. I'm sure she's loving the results of that and she's really supportive.  If you have questions to help you feel better or calm down, I'm here to answer them! I'm curious to hear more about your feelings and thoughts."
"I'm in love with my own gender, and my parents are against that. I don't know how to tell them because I'm afraid they'll not want me anymore.","Hello, and thank you for your question. This is one of those times when you wish you could assure someone that everything will go perfectly, but unfortunately I can't do that. There is no way of knowing how parents might respond until you tell them. The truth is that people have come out to their parents in many different ways. Some have told their parents directly, some drop hints, some have had others tell their parents, etc. The only ""right"" way to come out is the one that you choose. The one that feels right to you. That is the best way. Some people decide not to come out, and some wait for a very long time. Both of these things are okay. Coming out is deeply personal, and there can be real consequences to someone's emotional health and safety if they tell the wrong person. That is why it should only be done when you are ready. When you feel that you have the emotional and personal support that you need to take the risk. Sometimes people can feel pressured to come out, but I encourage you to do it in your own time. The truth is, there is a spectrum of how people's parents react to this kind of news. On one end, you may have the parents who shut a person out and are abusive, and on the opposite side you may have parents that are totally okay with it and throw you a ""Coming Out"" party. Most parents are going to fall somewhere in the middle. It is important to remember that their feelings may change over time. Many parents struggle at first, but they love their kids and get better with it over time. If you decide to tell them, consider taking someone along to support you. Plan ahead on what you want to say. It can be an emotional time, so do what you need to do to take care of yourself. If you need to, leave. You don't have to stay anywhere where someone is being cruel to you. I wish you well, and good luck.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC","A lot of people don't know how to handle love for their own gender. It is often a difficult situation with a lot of complex emotions. You feel the emotion, you love the person, but also have a fear of what your parents will think. If your parents don't feel or support you you won't be in a place that you could make a happy and healthy life for yourself. If your parents are against you, maybe you could ask them what they have been missing to get them to feel more accepted in your life. It is usually not about what you are ""supposed"" to be, but rather how you make a relationship work."
"I have been diagnosed with ADHD and experienced manic depression episodes. I have problems with anger management. Apparently, I also have an ODD, bipolar and split personality. How can I be truly happy?","The ADHD and manic depressive episodes are terms other people told you that you have.You don't have to accept these words to describe who you are.A lot of mental health in our country is about telling people what's wrong with them and giving pills for these so called conditions, instead of helping a person know more about themselves in order to make good decisions.You can be happy because nothing from the outside, such as the names people have used to tell you who you are, can interfere with your own wish to be happy.Others can slow you down because of the self-doubt and hurt feelings.  No one can take happiness from you, only they can make it harder to find and hold onto.Anger management only works temporarily because it is a surface approach.Think of the reason you are angry.  This will be better to know so you will be able to address it.Then you will not have anger to manage.","Since you're not sure if it is a diagnosis or no diagnosis, it is hard to say whether you are simply experiencing the symptoms of others or if these symptoms are more intense than others. It would be helpful to know your symptoms more for you to know if you are experiencing or not. At this time, I would suggest you reach out to a professional and go into the details with them as they will give you the best answer as it is possible, if there is no diagnosis to be discovered, that your symptoms have just simply become more and more intense in an unmanaged way. If they can't help you the only way is to go see another professional."
"I have a really bad temper. I get mad very easily then stay like that the whole day. I don't mean to be that way, but I can't help it.","A lot of times the anger someone expresses is from feeling a deep level hurt within themselves.   A surface situation, like, a store told you they'd have delivery of a certain item by Tuesday, and when that particular Tuesday comes, the store doesn't have what they told you they would, and you are furious.The fury may have more with many times before in your life, having been deeply let down by someone who mattered to your life at the time, who similarly promised something and failed to deliver whatever it.If at the time of feeling let down by someone important in your life, the relationship didn't allow for honest expression of all your emotions, you'd have learned to hold in what you realized would not be tolerated if you expressed it clearly.Without practice of being heard when feeling hurt by someone, eventually the person, possibly you, learned to contain and contain your emotions.It is possible that the anger you feel at a variety of situations lately, are muting hurt feelings that you've understood from relating to meaningful people in your personal history, to not talk about.As a way to find out if you feel other emotions in addition to anger, take some time to reflect on what triggered your anger and whether its possible that hurt emotions which nobody whom you know wants to hear,  are really the underlying source of your upset.I hope you will enjoy some new discoveries about yourself and your emotions!","I hope you don't mind, so I would like to ask about what is causing you to anger. Because I don't know your personal situation, you would have to spend a lot of time considering your feelings and why you have that anger. For someone with depression, anger is not an unusual feeling. If you don't know how to take care of yourself, try to find ways to be calm and relaxed. When you get angry, it is important to calm down and take a few deep breaths before responding.  I am sure you can find more ways to help you become more calm."
I'm constantly in a bad mood and I have no energy. Is that depression?,"Depression has many different signs and symptoms and looks different for every person.  Often times people think depression is more about feeling ""sad,"" but depression can, in fact, express itself through irritability (or bad mood as you say) and lack of energy.  According to the DSM-V (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), depression includes the following symptoms:-Depressed mood-Irritable mood-Decreased interest or pleasure in activities you usually participate in or enjoy-Significant weight change or change in appetite-Change in sleep (insomnia or hypersomnia)-Psychomotor aggitation or retardation-Fatigue or loss in energy -Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt-Diminished ability to concentrate or indecisiveness-Thoughts of suicide or plan The great news is that there are many ways to improve depressive symptoms.  If you are up for it, perhaps the best place to start is by seeing a physician or a therapist who can help determine how severe the depression is and can suggest methods of addressing the depression that fit your lifestyle, values, and capabilities.  Good luck!","That's a really important question to ask. Sometimes mood problems are related to depression. Depression can make you feel tired, hopeless, sad, restless, and has difficulty concentrating. Depression can be caused by many things, which includes genetics, family history, and other factors. However, if you have been having sadness and depression for at least two weeks, and you're missing most social events, and this has not been the case for long, depression is likely to be causing you a lot of pain. Depression is a treatable condition. It doesn't mean there's something wrong with you; it means the underlying issue doesn't need to be addressed. Some common treatment includes therapy and a medication.  If you're considering either of these treatments, it would be best to consult a mental health provider for an assessment."
"I feel like every time I do something someone asks me to, I never fully meet what they want. I feel that when I finish it, they always think that they should have picked someone else to do it. I feel like they just want nothing to do with me.","It sounds like you have the perception that people are frequently disappointed in you, wish you were different or someone else, and ultimately reject you. One question I would have for you is what is your evidence that people feel this way? Is there anything in people's words or behaviors that gives you this impression? If your not sure, it may be useful for you to try to notice what people say and do in response to you, even though you perceive these attitudes within them. Additionally, working with a competent therapist may be a great way to get an answer to your question as well as developing ways to move forward with that answer and gain a sense of self-esteem and security in your relationships.One possibility that comes to mind, of which there may be more, is that as we grow up, we often develop relational templates, or sets of expectations about how people are and will relate to us, which influence our experiences and behavior in relationships. Sometimes the templates that we develop to stay connected growing up are not particularly adaptive for adult life and can hamper our self-esteem and capacity for comfortable intimacy as an adult. You ask a great question here, and one that can be very hard to see through, given the difficulty of feeling that people think of you in this way, and I hope that you will stay curious about this and consider working with a therapist who is trained to help you discover the answer.","Hello. When you describe yourself as wanting less, that suggests that you can see yourself as the main event, so that when someone is asking you to do something, you see yourself as the main event. I’d suggest that the most important step you can take is to make sure you have clear intentions. Do your intentions come from an inner source that you can tell yourself, or do they come from the desires of those around you?When you have a strong inner purpose, that will motivate you in the direction you want to go."
