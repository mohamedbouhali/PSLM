"I found out today that my wife is cheating on me. I love her, but she won’t tell the truth even when I have proof. When I beg her to tell the truth, she yells, cusses, and gets a huge attitude.","Hi Prattville, I'm sorry this is happening to you. You need support right now, and yes, you need answers. She is in denial and is trying to hide the truth, to protect herself. This is a natural behaviour. You don't indicate whether she wants the marriage, or is planning to leave. Which way you go from here depends in part on the answer to that question. If she wants the marriage, you certainly have the right to say ""I need answers to all my questions"". Giving you the information she needs has to be (if she wants the marriage) more important than protecting herself. I would support your right to advocate for all the information you need in order to feel secure or make decisions. She may fear that the truth will turn you away. If you want to, you can reassure her that you want the marriage no matter what the truth is. If the marriage is to survive, it needs openness.If, on the other hand, she's planning to end the marriage, then you might want to resign yourself to the fact that you may never get the information you seek. You are better off, in that case, seeking support from friends and family rather than beating on a closed door. Your wife has some decisions to make. Try to give her a bit of time to make them. You can patiently say ""I know this thing is happening. Talk to me so we can deal with it together. I want to move forward but I need the truth."" Only time (and a good therapist, if she is willing and wants the marriage) will tell which way this one will go. Individually, you can seek professional help as well.","The amount of stress you have and the thought of having to go to court is terrible. If your wife does not want to confide, then you need to consider if your relationship is going to survive. Sometimes, people who are truly broken up, have lost the ability to trust each other in the first place. If so, then you may want to consider couples counseling before you start to think about divorce. The fact that she's been unable to admit to cheating makes it easier for you to have a divorce, as no one is trying to cover it up. If she does tell you then you can decide what your next steps are."
"My coworkers are making false statements about me to the boss, saying I have mood swings. They have no proof to back it up. Can my employer make me see a therapist of their choice?","If this is a concern of a few coworkers, make sure it is not something they see but you don't admit to.  Employers can ""suggest"" or something ""stipulate"" in continued employment with them  for you to go to their Employment Assistance Provider (EAP) if they have noticed the same behavior and concerned of how it is effecting productivity or employee relationships.  No one wants to work in a environment which they consider hostile.  Employers can be held responsible if they do not take action.Couple of things you can do...Ask a coworker in which you trust and respect if what others are saying is true?Seek professional help from your primary care provider or counselor if mood swings do exist.","I understand you're worried about what your coworkers are saying about you.  Your boss does not have any obligation to listen to your side of the matter.  Making statements about you is his responsibility.  If you know your boss's personal beliefs and values about employees and morale, you might look at your local state/local laws.  The idea of a supervisor making you see a therapist in order to help you stop and improve employee relations will likely be illegal.  If your boss does not listen, you could find other employers, or maybe just tell your boss that your coworkers are making false statements about you.   There is nothing to do with your coworkers other than simply not respond to their accusations."
"My boyfriend is in Ireland for 11 days, and I am an emotional wreck.","It sounds like you and your boyfriend are very close.  Do you typically spend most of your time together?  If so, it may be important to reflect on how you feel when you are apart.  If any separation is difficult, you may need to examine why.  Think about what it is that you miss and what you are anxious, upset or worried about.  If you examine the causes of your distress you likely will experience some relief.   It is important to learn how to be happy when you are alone, it will only improve the way you feel when you are with your boyfriend.","I think you are referring to this situation as something outside of your control. Your boyfriend lives in Ireland for 11 days, and his decision as to whether or not to be in Ireland is something you cannot control. All you can do is offer support in the way that you feel that you can. You can express what you feel as such, or you can support him as you see fit.  I hope this advice is helpful."
"When my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school, she starts crying and freaking out. She is a bright student, always has a 4.0, but I am afraid she is stressing too much. I’m afraid it’s going to break her. I don't know if I should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal.","Watching children go through challenges in their lives is difficult. On a very basic level, There exists a primal need to protect them from harm. The hard part for parents is letting them feel those challenges and working through them as they get older. At some point, there is a moment that occurs when the role as a parent shifts. Children no longer need the basics (food, shelter. water, safety) as much as when they were toddlers, but rather, their needs shift to wanting more support, encouragement, advice, and room to make mistakes. This is where the ability to communicate with them, letting them direct the sails to gather the wind needed to move, is so important. Keep the lines of communication open and be available to give feedback when they ask for it.","There is no ""normal"" stress, and being stressed is normal! Your daughter can have a little too much on her plate and can't manage her responsibilities. There are times of ""normal"" when the kids are less stressed because they're in a school of high school. Also, we often get stressed in the school. If this is happening to other times or other kids, please talk to your daughter and see what her counselor is saying. Perhaps this is an opportunity to discuss how you talk to your daughter and what she's going through. You could ask her what she's really stressed about and whether or not she is able to handle it without having a break or time for herself."
"It was over 20 years ago, but the pain has resurfaced again now because I have started seeing her Facebook posts about how great her life is. I feel so angry. How can I handle this?","Emotional pain is different from physical pain that way, isn't it? Even many years later, an old wound can be ripped open again by a small trigger.You were betrayed by two people close to you. That's a complex injury. I don't know whether you're still in the marriage or not, or whether your sister is still in your life. Perhaps not, as your contact with her seems to be through watching her facebook activity. I'm curious about why you're just now seeing her facebook posts again. Are you feeling more open lately to seeing how she's doing in her life? I guess if you were open to having your sister even in the periphery of your life again, you will have to figure out how to handle those triggers. If you can't, maybe consider unfollowing her or detaching from facebook for a while. So your sister is happy, or she at least appears happy. Your mind might go to some unhelpful places, like ""She doesn't regret the affair"" (you don't know that), ""She doesn't deserve happiness"" (that would be a harsh judgement), or ""She doesn't care that I'm hurt"" (again, there's no evidence of that). Where does your mind go? It's important to identify your worst thoughts in connection to her. When you have those worst thoughts identified, ask yourself ""What evidence supports that thought as truth?"" It's likely that either there's no evidence, or that the truth is so far from you that you can't know what she's feeling or thinking, which makes having those thoughts pretty futile.A therapist can help you determine what emotions are being triggered here. It doesn't help you and your happiness to carry around resentment, ill wishes, or the need for revenge. Forgiveness is not about saying that something was ""okay"". It's about saying ""It happened. I accept that I can't change it, and I don't want to carry the emotional burden around all the time"". Forgiveness is putting it down. She... (trust me this is true)...she carries her own burden of shame for what she did. For you to spend time feeling angry doesn't affect her burden. It only adds to yours. Can you find the tender emotion under your anger? You're hurt. Validate that hurt. Honour that hurt. Take care of that hurt. You can stay away from people who disregard your needs, and you have the power to forgive those who make mistakes out of their simple humanity if you want them in your life. If you continue to struggle, please seek the help of a professional who can assist you in navigating these waters. :)","This is an interesting and complex set of feelings. A great way to begin to explore how you feel when you see people like this is to think about your relationship with her. How do you feel about her? How has she treated you? Is there any possible way you do not need her presence in your life?  Or would you have preferred her to be different?  If you find the best way to feel about her is to keep your distance, you may want to consider it. It's also worth noting that while your feelings may be intensified and that you may feel angry, maybe there is some aspect of the relationship that is not so negative at all. Perhaps she is someone whom you have some positive memories of or which she has helped you grow as a person.   Sometimes, these things can be really good and make it easier to relate to other people you know.  This is one aspect of why we all do have strong memories of certain people!  As we grow and move forward in our life, we often grow and learn.  That includes learning to put our emotions in a way that is safe for us.  You may have been upset when your girlfriend of long ago was an event in your life and that is a valid feeling.  You want those memories to fade, you want those feelings to fade from your life.  How we process those events in our lives can help change how we feel about those events.    But it is important to note that those same memories will help you grow as a person.  Your past may surprise you, it may help you discover how you've grown as a person, and how you've learned from your experiences!   There is no right answer to this question, there may be many ways to feel about the person in your life.  As long as you are healthy, this is more than likely a matter of the person's healthiness for herself and for you.     What I would recommend to you is that you think about how to move forward with her now in order to not be caught in old emotional memories.       That, or                             �"
"I start to think of an issue that doesn't even matter or something bad that happened years ago. Then, I cry, pull at my hair, plug my ears, hit myself, and throw things. In loud public places, I get on edge and start being sarcastic and moody. I have an awful fear of people leaving me (which normally ends up happening) and I feel like I'm too clingy.","There is a reason you are having breakdowns. I can't agree that they happen for ""no reason at all"".   Finding out the reason is going to be your biggest challenge because that may require you to dig deep into your past, uncover hurtful experiences, or recognize something that would be extremely pain.  However, if you don't find professional help to carefully guide you through whatever you may confront, the symptoms mentioned will continue and may even get worse.  There is a light at the end of the road but you need some help to find the right road to get on so you can see it.","The fact that you are being so consistent in your reaction, even in public settings and you seem to be reacting in negative ways to the existence of people that don’t agree with you, is telling me that you're deeply insecure. Your behaviors are actually showing a lack of love from yourself and/or a pattern of thinking in terms of others' needs/attitudes over yours. People who care about you and aren't similar to you as much as you are to them, aren't going to care about your anxiety about their departure. All of those feelings are normal and if you are struggling with them, this is something to think about as you may have things in your own life that are hurting you that you are holding yourself back from seeking help with. Also, sometimes we have a ""we'll never have to deal with this"" mentality with all our friends and loved ones who we see and interact with so we're not looking for support when we need it.  This can create problems in relationships.  If this is the case, you may find it more helpful to have a therapist who helps us understand the patterns we're in and when you and others are similar and different. Also, therapy can help you recognize the pattern of anxious reactions and identify ways to deal with it in a more healthy way. The goal is to find ways to relate to other people who are different from you more positively, so that you may find that you do have friends, partners, and/or family who care about you, and who are not anxious about your behavior."
"My wife works late most days, so I'm lonely. I love my wife with all my heart, however I don't feel the intimacy we used to have. We don't have sex anymore, which bothers me tremendously. I have become close friends with a coworker, which I know is not helping. Nothing will happen with that, but there’s the thought.","First things first!  Friendships that develop in times of struggle may be a great emotional support, but also become confusing there's sexual attraction. And entertaining a tough is only going to make it a stronger target.  Careful with that friendship! You do not want to fill your marriage's void with another person.  Even when you are in a friend zone and not having intimacy with this person, you may be developing a special bond, sharing interest and activities that may lead to a deeper connection.  Ask yourself how you would feel if your spouse was having a friendship like that.Then try to refocus on your marriage. I suggest being transparent and talking to your wife about your feelings and concerns.  Ask her what you could do to reconnect, make some suggestions and dedicate time to practice them.  Make time in both of your schedules, make an effort to have lunch together, or to text during the day.  Remember that a marriage is like a very good friendship with benefits, but sometimes the responsibility kills the fun.¿Cómo puedo volver a enamorarme de mi esposa?Mi esposa trabaja tarde casi todos los días, la amo con todo mi corazón, pero no siento la intimidad como antes.  Ya no tenemos sexo, lo cual me molesta tremendamente.  Me he acercado a una amistad del trabajo, lo cual no ayuda.  Nada pasara, pero hay pensamientos al respecto.Primero lo primero! Las amistades que se desarrollan en momentos de crisis pueden ser un gran apoyo emocional, pero también pueden convertirse en algo nebuloso cuando hay atracción sexual. Entretener pensamientos al respecto solo lo va a hacer un reto más grande.  ¡Ten cuidado con esa amistad! No quieres llenar el vacío que deja tu matrimonio con esta nueva persona.  Aunque no estés teniendo intimidad con esa persona, puedes estar creando una conexión especial, compartiendo intereses en común y actividades que los unen más aun. Pregúntate como te sentirías si tu esposa tuviera una amistad así.Intenta reenfocarte en tu matrimonio.  Sugiero que seas transparente con tu esposa y le dejes saber tu preocupación y como te sientes con el distanciamiento.  Pregúntale que le gustaría hacer para reconectarse, sugiérele algunas ideas y dediquen tiempo a las mismas.  Hagan tiempo en sus agendas para ustedes, hagan un esfuerzo para almorzar juntos, y comunicarse durante el día, aunque sea con textos.  Recuerda que el matrimonio es como una muy buena amistad con beneficios y muchas veces las responsabilidades matan la diversión.","You have 6 days to do something new or creative that you've been wanting to try. Then what will happen, 6 days from now, when you revisit it, will you still feel that way?"
"My boyfriend shows affection, but I just push him away. Every time my boyfriend tries to kiss, hug, or touch me I almost always push him away. I'm on birth control and it has killed my sex drive.     I love him so much. Why do I do this?","There could be many reasons that you push your boyfriend away. It could be part of how you were raised, it could be because of culture, it could even be your own insecurities about yourself that are then outwardly manifested in you ""pushing"" him away. What is important in all this is that you both find a way to connect. So what if you aren't a hugger, a kisser, or a toucher you have to find what works for the both of you and your relationship. There are many ways to show affection that aren't physical (words of affirmation, giving of time and/or gifts, etc). If your boyfriend wants the physical attention then work on ways that are comfortable for the both of you making sure to start out slow and to work your way up to more physical touching.",Your questions are beautiful and very valid. I hope you feel safe enough to be honest with yourself about the answer.I wish you luck in finding the answer to your questions. I don't know if you'll like what you find.
I haven't been feeling like myself lately. I've been upset for no reason and feeling anxious. I'm feeling burnt out. What can help me feel better?,"Does it help to put a name to the experience you are having? Where you first said, ""I've been upset for no reason and feeling anxious,"" you then say that you are ""feeling burnt out,"" which gives a little more context to what may have once felt like ""no reason."" Perhaps you are feeling burnt out! That is a big deal, and please try not to take it lightly! When we get burnt out, I have found that it's from one of two things: either we are not doing what we want, or we are doing too much (either of something we want or something we don't, doesn't really matter once we get into doing too much.)If either of those rings true for your experience, try as much as possible to sit with the experience and get a better sense of where the burn out is coming from. I wrote about burnout for a newsletter and it is on my website. I don't want to do shameless promotion, but I thought it could also add to helping you: https://davidkleintherapy.com/my-experiences-with-burnout/I hope that you can also see that it's not an abnormal experience.","You feel yourself being upset with no reason and feeling anxious. I know that you have a need for grounding, and the answer to that question is to focus on it in your thoughts.
If you feel the need to be grounded (to feel less anxious) you can focus on your senses.  What do you see? A tree, a tree and the sky in the background, or more of a particular landscape.  What do you hear? The sound of traffic, water or the wind blowing through trees.  What do you smell? A grassy smell, a flower, or woodsy. What do you taste? Coffee or something sweet on your lips.  What do you feel? The sun on your skin or the wind on your clothes.
These are all ways to ground yourself in the present. I hope this helps?"
"There is just no communication at all between us. She sleeps constantly all day (not at night). She acts angry and unfocused and stays in her very messy room all the time. The only time she comes out is to eat.    She has aches and fatigue, weight gain, hair loss and skin problems. She does not look after her health.
   I don't know how to communicate with her. She is not open to any suggestions. How do I get through to her?","1. She's an adult.2. She lives in your house? She follows your rules.3. What you're describing could be any number of things, but could potentially be a medical issue that needs attention. Thyroid issues, autoimmune diseases - there's a ton of medical possibilities for her symptoms. I'm not a doctor; this is a forum of therapists.4. I recommend the book ""Codependent No More"" which may help you navigate your rocky relationship with your adult daughter. You may be inadvertently making things worse by ""helping"" her which can instead enable her to continue her behaviors. Another book you may find helpful is ""Boundaries: Where you end and I begin"". You cannot control another person, especially an adult. The only person you can control is yourself. Tough love is sometimes needed, and she is an adult - treat her like one. Maybe then she'll act like one. If we were having this conversation in person, you would interrupt me at this point with a ""but..."" and then explain all the reasons why you can't tell her to move out, get a job, get up and cook or clean the house, etc. I already know that you have a myriad of excuses for things being the way they are. Yes, I said excuses instead of reasons, because that's what they are. You may feel stuck and like you have to take care of her, but you have choices - you just may not like them. I know that when children are small, parents' lives are focused around them (some more than others) and decisions are made around what is best for your child. But you said your daughter is an adult. The relationship dynamics must change if the relationship is to be a healthy one. I know how difficult it is to watch your child make life choices that you wouldn't want for them, no matter what that choice may be. As a parent, we want to force them to do what we think is ""the right thing"" but trying to do that only results in frustrations for everyone involved. Whether the issue is a hair color, a tattoo, a lifestyle choice, a job, or choosing not to work or take care of their health, or doing drugs, or drinking - the choice is theirs and theirs alone and so are the consequences of those choices.","So, here's what you are communicating: You have a woman who is not communicating with you, but who is still hurting and who does not have an appetite for health care or food. One of the most relevant communication issues in your case is one that you may not even be aware of. You may not have heard her complain about fatigue, lack of appetite, and unexplained aches and pains. The rest of your story seems like she is sleeping all day and you are worried about her health. Are there other things that are happening in her life that she is not saying to you? Has she been involved in an accident or some other incident recently? Has she suffered from any trauma or loss? Are there other stressors or events in her life that may be upsetting her? Does she have any current or past relationship issues, or conflicts with her family members or friends?Is she being bullied at school or work? Is she being chased by someone she dislikes? If there are any of these problems that are bothering her, it may make the most sense to have the chance to talk to her to find out what's going on. If there are no obvious reasons why she is not communicating what is going on, you can talk to another trusted family member and have them tell her what is going on. If there are any specific health concerns she is having, you may want to have her talk to her doctor and get things sorted out.   If she has a history of mental health issues or she's not able to communicate herself effectively, then consider seeking help.If the above is a little too big of a leap, then you can focus on what you are saying to her and focus on building trust.If you are comfortable doing so, then you could consider asking her if there is anything she's afraid to say if it is really bad. She will feel safe with you because she knows that you are going to listen to her and care about her.You can work to get her talking with you about what is going on in her life. I hope this helped."
My two adult sons live with me. One has been having panic attacks and hasn't been able to work for over 6 months. He doesn't want to get help. I'm feeling so overwhelmed. What can I do?,"My very first thought is this is so much to carry on your own!  A mother's instinct is to care for her children so I can imagine how hard it must be to see your son in pain and struggling.  I hear a ping of helplessness in there as well.  That's heavy.My question is: who is supporting you?  I know nothing about the context, but I wonder if the role you hold often is that of caretaker.  It may not be that the end-all-be-all answer is to be cared for, but the absence of care (or even self-care) can seem like we are only existing for others.  Sometimes having someone to rely on can help take off some of the edge--the pressure--of all that is overwhelming.Despite that, it may be that the situation continues to be exactly what it is, providing a steady stream of stress for you (which would be so difficult).  I don't think anyone can tell you what to do because no one here has to live with those consequences, good or bad.  Just a note that sometimes with men it is harder to reach out for help.  Perhaps he feels comfortable enough for you to know he's struggling (which means you have provided him a safe space to do just that) but not comfortable enough to interact with a stranger about those same struggles.  Men often avoid therapy because it's seen as weak and/or means you need help.  Planting seeds here is sometimes all you can do, as hard as that is.As far as supporting goes, there's much more you can do there if he is ready to receive that.  If you are seeing him in the midst of panic, the best thing you can do is let him know you are there for him.  Maybe that means being there physically, or continuing to give him encouragement along the way (e.g., ""You got this"", ""I know this is hard"", etc.).  If you aren't present for the attacks but he's telling you about them, you can ask what you can provide for him in those moments or how you can help him afterward.  Panic attacks can be taxing on the body so sometimes people need time to recover.  Remember that you also need to recover here, too.  It's very painful to watch someone you love panic.  What might you need there?Of course, counseling can be a great place to work through that stress and overwhelm.  That time is all for you to be heard and understood.  You deserve to have someone there for you, too!","Let's start by asking ourselves a question: What is your biggest fear and need?   What do your sons need from your life right now? Your needs to keep from hurting them, to feel loved and supported?  Knowing what's truly important to you might be the first step toward addressing the situation.  When you care about the health and well-being of your sons, you show them you love them, and you make sure they know that you care about their well-being�������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������"
"I'm a male in my early 20s. Lately, my paranoia about being around kids is causing me too breathe heavy and sweat a lot. I then start to act weird because I'm trying to fight my paranoia. This leads to people starring at me because they don't know that I'm suffering from panic attacks and paranoia. They just notice me acting scared around kids and they think I'm a threat because of it.    I'm not a pervert or predator. I would never hurt a kid. I like kids and don't know why I'm so scared to be around them.    I don't understand why I feel like this. Am I a bad person? How do I make this stop?","In our practice, many people we see have unwanted thoughts of doing harm to children - physically or sexually. As you said, these are intrusive and unwanted thoughts - not genuine desires to harm them. This is a form of OCD we often call Harm or Pedophilic OCD. What you are describing here as ""paranoia"" sounds similar to this, and is so demoralizing because you are dealing both with the distress of these unwanted thoughts and feelings, as well as the fear and uncertainty about your own character as a good person.If this is really what is going on (further assessment by the right professional would determine this), the current gold standard approach to addressing OCD is Exposure with Response Prevention - in this case, confronting the feared situations, thoughts or images on purpose, rather than avoiding them, until they lose the fear and shame associated with them.","Your paranoia is not a great personality trait to have. What is not wrong is that you try to fight it by changing your way of interacting with people you like around them. People who have this type of fear usually don't realize it in their way and just look for a way to deal with it in the only way they know. They're thinking about the 'what's-happening-to-me' and they are then trying to get out of the thought in a way that works for them. Maybe it is easier for them to say ""don't be so silly and not worry."" But you would say something about their anxiety and wonder ""why do you have this feeling?"" in a way that they wouldn't get in the way of what you're trying to accomplish, which is to calm the panic. It could be more helpful to try to learn more about your own anxiety and what your body feels like when it is in the act of panic. Also you have to be clear with yourself that you are in control of your own mind and that you have to get out of the thinking process before you have to do anything else."
I'm very depressed. How do I find someone to talk to?,"You have already taken the brave first step of making the decision to heal from it and find a professional that will help you do so. There are lots of different options nowadays for therapists, as you can see them online or in an office.  My biggest tip for you is to use Psychology Today or Counsel Chat to find a therapist.  Enter in your zip code and you will find many different therapists you can talk to . Be sure to find someone that you most resonate with and ask them any questions you may have. Many  times, therapists will provide free consultations and this can be a great opportunity to see if you are a good fit.","You're right, your feelings and the ones people have are right. It's a good sign that you are feeling that way and seeking out a friend or group to talk to about it. When you ask for help, you might find that your friends can talk to you, and you can talk to your friends about what you think is going on with your depression."
"I don't know what's with me. I'm almost constantly angry. Even when I'm happy, I still feel anger inside me. When I acknowledge it, it ruins my mood and takes over. I get angry at the littlest things. Even if I think someone said something they didn't, it infuriates me. Something perfectly normal can make me go off. When my anger flares up, I get a terrible pain in my chest that lasts for a while. It's like there is a fire constantly burning in my body, and anger is gasoline.","Hi Nashville, I'm glad you want this to be different. It doesn't feel good to be angry all the time, and it's stealing your energy as well as affecting relationships, I'm sure.Working with a therapist, you can learn to recognise the deep emotions that lie underneath the anger. It's likely to be either powerlessness or worthlessness, and what happens is this... a small moment in the present touches on an old, tender, bruised emotion that we've simply felt too much of or too strongly in the past. We develop ways of avoiding these vulnerable emotions, and anger is one way of doing that. So, when someone looks at you in a certain way, or says something, you'd rather be angry than feel powerless, or unimportant (or whatever your kryptonite feeling is). In that moment, your instinct is to blame whatever happened, no matter how small, because that's the thing that happened just before you got mad. You fail to recognise that the problem is not the look on that person's face, or the shoe that someone left in front of the door...it's that you can't stand feeling something and you want to avoid it like you want to stamp your foot out if it's on fire.I suggest finding a therapist to work with. You can learn to take responsibility for your old emotions and find new ways to manage them. :)","Hi,I'm glad you said you know what your anger is with, but for now, I think you need a little more research before we move on to therapy.You said you feel a pain in your chest when it flares up.Sometimes a physical pain gets you really upset, but in this case is this about how you feel inside.The pain in your chest is not only an alarm.It is a signal to seek help.It would be a very good idea to talk to a doctor about this.If you are experiencing chest pain, I would definitely recommend seeing one.I have no idea what the reason is for your anger, but there may be a good chance that it comes in response to some sort of problem within yourself, whether it be your work, or relationship or if you are depressed.If you are feeling like this is an ongoing or if you can't control it, talk to your doctor, or a counselor about where to turn next to start the healing process.For now though, consider this a signal that something is off with you, and is in need of attention.  I am so sorry to hear that you are finding this difficult to cope with, and I wish you the best of luck in finding the proper therapy to help you feel better.I hope you hear from a professional counselor in the near future for help!"
"I constantly feel like everyone is up against me and trying their best to shut me down. It's ruining my mood and even my whole self. I have trouble sleeping, and I keep having sleep paralysis while dreaming of others mocking and judging me.","The problem you describe sounds very wearing on your spirit.Are there particular reasons for why you feel everyone hates you?Have you been in a clash of ideas or opinions and feel yourself in the minority viewpoint?Or does your sense of being shut out start within your own mind, as though you anticipate that others will not like what you say?If actual conversations are leading you to feel left out, then evaluate whether to bring up certain points to the other person.Or, you may also decide that the relationships in which you feel shut out, are no longer worthwhile ones for you.If the problem is hesitating to interact because you imagine others will reject you, then maybe you can coach yourself into trying a small step toward introducing yourself and your thoughts to others.","""I don't know if you'll find this help, but I've been working a lot with the idea of people who treat themselves like the person they think they're dealing with. It sounds like you can handle it, as you feel like ""no one"" is there to help you through this, but it is true that our brains don't have the capacity to handle some of the world's challenges, and in the face of an overwhelming amount of mental health information and therapy, we try to just ""manage"" things instead of letting them go.  The issue is that you can't stop them from trying to shut down someone who is trying to stop with them. If it's for the best, people will always keep trying.  You need to try and take back your life and what is the best way to do that?"
"I'm going through some things with my feelings and myself. I barely sleep and I do nothing but think about how I'm worthless and how I shouldn't be here.
   I've never tried or contemplated suicide. I've always wanted to fix my issues, but I never get around to it.
   How can I change my feeling of being worthless to everyone?","Hello, and thank you for your question and seeking advice on this. Feelings of worthlessness is unfortunately common. In fact, most people, if not all, have felt this to some degree at some point in their life. You are not alone. Changing our feelings is like changing our thoughts - it's hard to do. Our minds are so amazing that the minute you change your thought another one can be right there to take it's place. Without your permission, another thought can just pop in there. The new thought may feel worse than the last one! My guess is that you have tried several things to improve this on your own even before reaching out on here. People often try thinking positive thoughts, debating with their thoughts, or simply telling themselves that they need to ""snap out of it"" - which is also a thought that carries some self-criticism. Some people try a different approach, and there are counselors out there that can help you with this. The idea is that instead of trying to change the thoughts, you change how you respond to them. You learn skills that allow you to manage difficult thoughts and feelings differently so they don't have the same impact on you that they do right now. For some people, they actually DO begin to experience less hurtful thoughts once they learn how to manage the ones they have differently. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy may be a good choice for you. There is information online and even self-help books that you can use to teach you the skills that I mentioned. Because they are skills, they require practice, but many people have found great relief and an enriched life by learning them. As for suicidal thoughts, I am very glad to read that this has not happened to you. Still, you should watch out for this because it can be a sign of a worsening depression. If you begin to think about this, it is important to reach out to a support system right away. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. The text line is #741741. I hope some other colleagues will provide you more suggestions. Be well...Robin Landwehr, DBH, LPCC","Your feeling of being worthless is your brain's way of telling you that a problem is occurring. You are telling yourself, ""You have a problem"", and you aren't in touch with your feeling of needing a therapist.  It is very common for people to believe that they are in control of what happens in their lives and that if they are thinking and feeling negative thoughts they can change them to positive ones. However, what's usually happening in the back of our heads is that our thoughts are so overwhelming, we do not actually have a great deal of control over our thoughts.  Your brain has a lot of trouble learning. If something has been going on in your life for a long time, and your brain is not trained to process it well, you may not see how it is affecting you at all.  If you can learn the way to manage your thoughts such as as mindfulness, the ""mindfulness"" is a technique where you are aware of your thoughts but not judgement you of them. If you have a very harsh critic inside your head that is judging you in very harsh ways, then you need to have a much more helpful way to deal with those kinds of negative thoughts. Your brain is working the best it can, however, your emotional feelings about your self-worth can be anything from very positive and uplifting to very negative, but are rarely the most important thing.  Your own self-esteem is often tied to a feeling that you are worthy of love, attention, respect and safety.  \
If you are dealing with anxiety, depression, and feeling worthless, it may be helpful to seek help from a doctor, but your mental health will be in much better health if you seek out a professional like a counselor and psychotherapist.  I hope that this information has been helpful for you.  Feel free to reach out to a friend or family member for some support and talk about them. If you are really having trouble coping with your thoughts and feelings, and you really are asking yourself, ""How do I feel or what am I doing"", I would be sure to ask a psychotherapist, it's really hard to get out of your own mind when you are in pain."
I have always wanted to have a transition from male to female for some time now. This issue has persisted for 10 years already but I don't know where to start. I do not have the soundest information either.,Wonderful!  I am so excited for you.  What a huge decision.  I am writing from Toronto Canada so it is hard for me to direct you specifically.  I would start with two things 1) Find a doctor that is comfortable perscribing hormones and 2) find a Counsellor or Therapist that is transgender specialized.  They will know how transitioning works in your health care system and other supports as well.  Google is a wonderful way to find these resources.   I wish you well. Thanks for writing!,"I hope that as you continue to explore your gender identity, that you will have opportunities to learn more about your own experiences, and the experiences of others. And as you explore your gender identity, remember that there will be a lot of different paths, and what has worked for one person may not work for another. Also, the most important thing is that you will not feel bad or guilty about the way that you feel, and whether the way you feel is considered ""correct"". It is your body, and your mind, and your experience of yourself which are most important. You have to focus on getting a sense of who you are internally as your only primary, and it's not something one can easily know through the world outside of oneself."
"I think i may suffer from depression, and it is affecting my life and sleep. I am on my parent's insurance, and they won't let me see a therapist because they don't believe in it.","The answer here really depends upon your age and something called the ""age of consent"" in the state where you live. In Pennsylvania, anyone over the age of 14 can provide consent for their own treatment. As for billing purposes, try talking to some local agencies. If you are under 18, you may be able to have Medicaid out of medical necessity so that you can have treatment. If you are over 18, there may be some discounted rates at some agencies because of the situation you're in. Maybe your primary care physician will be able to refer you to some local agencies.If you are in school, you may be able to talk with a guidance counselor or someone at the school. This would not require using your insurance.","I've always been a believer in therapy. As a person, I see how depression is a complicated condition which affects people differently. Sometimes, I hear people talking about therapy and how they do feel about it. It's true that therapy can have difficult aspects. For example, some people feel like it's like they’re being blamed for being down. For me, it's more about taking some responsibility for my own life for a long time and just learning some new skills to do better.I strongly suggest reading all of the information to find out about this as it doesn't mean it's not possible to heal, it just means that if you have an existing mental health issue you need to be responsible about having a long term plan for recovery! It does take some effort and work to see a therapist and work on making changes, but it is also worth it. And the worst thing about it is that you may not realize how you’ve been suffering for a very long time. If you feel like there is some way you could have done better, then we should talk more about that."
"My boyfriend is always saying he's done with me and says he's leaving, but then at the end of the night, he's still here. He wakes up in the morning, acts like nothing happen, and repeats this every night.","Do the two of you ever talk over why he does this or your reaction to it?Are you asking your question because his behavior upsets you or only out of curiosity to understand him better?Basically, first know your own reason for your question.   Then go ahead and tell him if what he does bothers you.  In the best of cases, he doesn't realize how his actions affect you and he will change.","Hi, I'm happy for you to have a life and relationship, however, there's a difference between having the freedom to be alone and one person being free to leave another person, for a reason that is at least partially one to one to their own values and life choices, and sometimes, to simply, completely, and irreversibly, be in the place of someone that is fully and wonderfully content, being happy and free, and being completely free of the need to be with someone. Sometimes people stay in a relationship because it's safe for them, for any reason, and that safety is all they can handle. If this is the case for you then you know the feeling of feeling safe in a relationship and knowing that you are truly valued and respected and that your needs are being met, even if that means that the relationship is not fulfilling, to your needs. But it's hard to call anything relationship right or wrong unless you're clear about what each person wants and needs, and what is safe for you on a day to day basis.   I'm sure all of your boyfriend is doing well at this moment in his life and he understands what he likes and does. I would strongly suggest talking to him to see whether he might be willing to talk with you and see what he can offer you.  If he is willing to engage in that kind of discussion, then a life together is one way to have a partnership that goes beyond physical intimacy."
"I'm a Christian teenage girl, and I have lost my virginity. My boyfriend is a Christian teenager too, but things just got out of hand between us in a sexual manner. I planned to abstain from sex but I guess I wasn't clear about this because I was also tempted and led him on. We continued to have sex. Does it mean that he isn't the one God planned for me? We're so young, but that doesn't stop me from dreaming of a potential future together. I really do feel like he is in my life for an important reason. I'm incredibly happy for I was able to escape from several abusive relationships because of him. I love him very much.","Having sex with your boyfriend is and was a mistake. Mistakes can be forgiven and you can make amends.But it is not the end of your relationship or God's will for you.Have a serious talk with your guy and get back on track with where you want to be. Talk to a counselor or your priest/pastor. Get someone to be your guide and mentor. Check in with them regularly.Getting back to square one could actually strengthen your relationship.Have a plan for the future where you will not be put into a place of temptation. Group dates, public places and no alone time where temptations might arise.Forgive yourself and move on.","You are welcome to do what feels right to you and what brings you as much joy as possible. There is no way to control your life or what brings to you as much joy as your romantic love. You are free to decide whether or not you are attracted to him, and you have the right to deny yourself pleasure. You are free to decide whether or not you're happy to be with him and what you would like to continue doing in your marriage.  If you are seeking a spiritual guide for you as a teenage girl, I think that you need to consider that the Church and its teachings may be better than a psychologist. It is a good place to have a great deal of support and guidance, and if you feel like you need more, it may be helpful to seek one that is more spiritual than a psychologist."
"They don't go away, and I feel like I'm going crazy. Does that ever stop? Can it be a symptom of medication?","Since you realize that hearing voices in your head is not usual for you, then definitely there is a problematic situation happening within your awareness of who you are.if you recently started taking a new drug or increased dosage of one you already were taking, and the voices started shortly after, then yes, it is possible medication created your problem.Start by telling whoever gave you the presecription, about the problem you're having.""Crazy"" has some flexibility as to whether someone is this way or not.Certainly a very positive sign that you're not crazy, is that you're self-aware of a problem within yourself. And, you're responsible toward yourself and making effort to address this problem.Crazy people usually don't do responsible behaviors.","It's good you feel the way you feel when you question the question itself. I've had a similar situation with myself. I'm looking for help and I feel confused. I feel the need for comfort when I feel overwhelmed in a mental health context. How did you feel as a child after your parents died? If I could visit your childhood home today, I would have to visit my parents' tombstone right away.   How did you feel then?"
"My dad doesn't like the fact that I'm a boy. He yells at me daily because of it and he tells me I'm extreme and over dramatic.
   I get so depressed because of my dad's yelling. He keeps asking me why I can't just be happy the way I am and yells at me on a daily basis. Is this considered emotional abuse?","Maybe this is emotional abuse.It certainly is irritating and annoying to be yelled at for being yourself.Maybe at a time when he's not yelling you can bring up the topic of your own willingness, if this is true, to discuss questions he has about your gender.There's no guarantee he won't start yelling midway through a dialogue like this.  Only then you will be on firm ground to excuse yourself from the conversation since you already explained that you're willing to talk with him and not to be yelled at by him.","You wrote ""I get so depressed because of my dad's yelling."" I understand that this is a painful expression from your perspective that is hurting you as you may not be aware of it at all.  You did get a little bit of this situation from a more distant point of view. If your dad yelling at you is considered emotional abuse (sometimes called ""parental emotional abuse"") it is not something to be surprised by. It's important to remember that while your dad is yelling at you, this is not your fault. You are not responsible for his yelling.  You may want to talk to your Dad about this. The more you know about what he is and isn't doing, the better you can communicate with him."
"I know someone who is extremely sensitive to stress and very sensitive to a negative tone of voice. Sometimes during a disagreement he tells me that my communication is having a harmful impact on him. Once he believes I am being negative I can't seem to find a better way of communicating. In fact, it is often a self fulling prophesy because his accusatory manner becomes unbearably frustrating.    What advice might you offer?","With any type of criticism, it is usually best to introduce the topic at a neutral time, ie: when both of you are relaxed, with no current stressors involved, having fun, etc.  Begin with a non-judgmental reflective comment about a recent bothersome event, as if it were just then crossing your mind (therefore not something you've been consumed with ruminating over - eases the impulse for him to dive straight into defense mode).Then share how you felt at the time of the event.  Just say when.... I felt kind of hurt / shocked (or whatever the feeling was).  PERIOD.  THATS ALL YOU SHOULD SAY.  Wait for him to respond to your matter-of-fact statement.No matter what his response is, stick to your same message - don't get overwhelmed by trying to rephrase or explain your view as that will likely set you up for continued arguing.  You can even add, ""I agree I could have misunderstood  it (event).... I just know it made me feel uneasy.""Here you give him little wiggle room for a debate.Good luck & I'd love to hear how it goes!","You have a good point here. I've been asking around about the use of negative sentiment in communicating. I have some ideas for the individual's reaction that is the core of my expertise when addressing the sensitive issues that affect each individual. 

Here’s what I’d like to offer the individual to address this question. I have the following ideas for your consideration:

1. **Awareness:** I'd encourage the person to recognize when you're using your tone of voice as a negative expression. When you notice your voice begins to express negative comments, I would recommend that you practice in talking to someone, whether it is a family member or friend.  When I tell the person to notice they are saying things negatively, I always have them remind themselves that there is another way to react to situations."
"My dad beat and mentally abused me so badly that I can't function properly. Letting go of the past is important to moving on and getting better, but I’m terrified to get better because I don't even know who I am without the trauma. I've never gotten to be myself. I don't even know who I am.",I am so sorry to hear that you are struggling.  Getting to know yourself after a trauma (especially at the hands of a caregiver) and learning to trust yourself can feel terrifying.  I would encourage you to seek out a trauma therapist who can work with you slowly and at your pace.  You are not your trauma.  You are good and you are whole.  Please seek out the support of a therapist who sees that in you.,"I am very sorry to hear you haven't been able to live a fulfilling, happy, and whole life, as your parents did, because you have not been able to find the good relationship with your own mom, let alone to be a part of your own life. How much have you struggled? How many times have you been told that the world is wrong? What has your mom done to keep you in this state? Where have you been? The important question is where I've been - for 20 years now - is, I was the primary source of both my joy and my pain, as well as many days of my life. I feel you're wondering, ""Is there something to learn from me?"" The truth is, I didn't know anything, and I'm not sure I have any part to learn about this at all, I've tried to look for ways to understand how others act from a position of harm because that is the most likely cause in so many instances. There isn't a reason why you cannot have these kinds of feelings that are associated with the past. I have been there too. If you are going through a similar amount of time of emotional chaos, therapy can provide a way to get through it in a safe place. We need to examine your thoughts and emotions, to understand what is causing the pain and suffering of someone you are no longer attached to, and to find ways to change your thinking and behavior and develop better methods for your own well-being."
I was violently raped by another women who was my friend of 13 years. I’m having bad flashbacks. I’m scared to sleep because I see it in my dreams. I don't leave the house because I have panic attacks.,"I'm sorry for your suffering.There are therapy programs which help people to gradually feel more at ease so that daily living does not feel so frightening.Once you feel stronger and more secure from such a behavioral program, you'll be able to sleep more peacefully and leave the house whenever necessary to do your regular life.Then, you will be able to open and clear the deep emotional hurt that always occurs from being violated by a trusted friend.Sending good wishes in your work!","My name is Rachel. I am a therapist specializing in trauma. It is wonderful that you seek help. I wish I could say that the scars are gone. I wish you could give you back the peace that is yours. If you were to talk to a good therapist that specializes in trauma, then I might have advice.  My advice would be, stay in contact with your therapist and continue to see them, if you want to get where you want to be.  It would help to talk to your therapist as soon as possible in order to give them a full picture of your struggles.   If possible, find a therapist that specializes in trauma, as that would help to guide you in your healing journey.  I would start by talking to the therapist for a free consultation.I wish you the best of luck and let me know what you think of the therapist's feedback."
I have dog obsession disorder and I am having problems with my girlfriend because I am placing more importance to my two dogs over her. How do I get over this problem and prioritize my girlfriend over my two dogs?,"Hey, dogs are cool. They adore pleasing humans and often LOVE to work on learning what you want and expect from them. Your girlfriend on the other hand, likely has her own desires and needs that she attend to before tuning into yours. You are good with dogs, that tells me that you've spent some time observing their behavior. The first step in working through this issue would be similar, start to tune into and observe your girlfriend more often... Observation is a skill when it comes to relationship building. The skills you have mastered in relating with your dogs can carry over, you will just have to relearn what behaviors you are watching. And keep in mind that also means observing yourself in relationships.","It's wonderful that you are willing to recognize your problem and seek help and guidance. I'm sorry to hear you're struggling to find a balance between your dogs and your girlfriend. This requires your active and consistent effort. One of the important things to remember is that your dogs are living beings who have very similar needs to you in terms of care, attention, and affection. A dog who is constantly being ignored is not going to be a happy dog. When you spend time with you girlfriend, you also get to take a break with your dogs and spend time together as a couple. This is not what is expected of you and your girlfriend and can help your dogs feel the same way. However, taking time with your girlfriend and your dogs is not necessarily going to solve the problem of what to do with your dogs. If your dogs are not as excited as you are to see your girlfriend, then you must think about what needs to happen in order for your dogs to be happy and get excited about spending time with your girlfriend.  In my experience, there are lots of strategies that can be applied. Some of these include:     1) Make sure you spend quality time together as a couple. Your girlfriend should not feel like she has to prioritize the dogs first.     2) Make sure to spend quality time with you dogs. While spending time with your girlfriend is vital, your dogs need attention and affection just as much.     3) Find new activities for your dogs that keep them excited and excited, such as walks, playtime, and training sessions.     4) Reward for getting love from you and your girlfriend.    5) Give your dogs' favorite treats and toys.     6) Make sure your dogs have enough enrichment such as puzzle toys and chew toys.     7) Give your dogs plenty of attention and affection.     8) Be patient with your dogs, since changing them takes time.     9) Allow your dogs to have time to sleep alone.     10) Your girlfriend does not need to take a break from her life to try and make your dogs happy.     11) Make sure your girlfriend doesn't feel pressured to do anything for you."
"Whenever I have to speak in public or be in big crowds, I freak out. I get light-headed, sweaty, and I have trouble breathing.","Basically, your response is the fight, flight or freeze reaction
which is hard wired into the human nervous system, specifically, the autonomic nervous system (called the autonomic response).  This system
is responsible for regulating the heart, digestion, respiratory rate
as well as other aspects which match the symptoms you describe.  It is largely an unconscious function, but
with training it can be managed such as a public speaking course in which you
prepare and even have some exposure to smaller experiences to help you prepare
and cope for larger presentations.  One of the greatest applications of
addressing this response is the NASA program which exposes the astronauts to situations
they will encounter while in space which will trigger the response so that when
it does happen (not if but when) that they are able to move through the
challenge with success.  You can learn
more about his by going to TED Talks “What I learned about going blind in space” It is
a truly inspiring look at what you are experiencing as well as how to deal with
it. 
With that being said, finding a program
like a Dale Carnegie Public Speaking program can help.  Working with a counselor who can help you
utilize visualization of an upcoming speech has been shown to help and you can
always talk to your doctor to see what options might be available there as
well. Good luck!","It sounds like you may have asthma.  This is usually more common in school or office environments due to your high level of noise and the number of people in the room.  See a doctor to determine if your symptoms are asthma related, as well as test your respiratory system. The first step is always to see a medical doctor to determine whether or not you have asthma and how to control symptoms if asthma is the cause."
"When I get around a particular person or when I go home, I'm just sad or irritated. The feeling comes and goes all day every day. I don't know what wrong. I'm not sure if I'm just making up symptoms and problems in my head or if there is something actually wrong.","Feelings are real, is very unlikely that you are making them up since they are a response to the thoughts in your mind and your daily experiences and interactions. Often we assume that feeling sadness is bad and that we should only feel happiness and joy; but all feelings have a purpose: joy, sadness, anger, frustration, excitement, anxiety, among others.   Is not healthy to experience the same feeling for a long time, so we should learn to identify what causes them and how to process them so you can navigate through life experiences with more ease.

No sé qué está mal.  No estoy seguro si estoy inventando los síntomas y problemas en mi cabeza o si algo realmente está mal. Los sentimientos son muy reales, y es muy poco probable que los estés inventando, por que los sentimientos son una respuesta tanto a los pensamientos que hay en nuestra cabeza, y, a las situaciones que nos ocurren día a día.  Muchas veces pensamos que sentirnos triste está mal, y que solo debemos sentirnos alegres, pero todas las emociones tienen un propósito y razón de ser, tanto la alegría, como la tristeza, el coraje, la frustración, la excitación o el desespero, entre otros.  No es bueno quedarnos estancados una emoción.  Así que es importante aprender a identificar que causa nuestros sentimientos, como procesarlos para poder superar nuestras emociones y movernos de una experiencia a otra con más tranquilidad.

Do you like to have a close relationship, and if so, where do you feel most you can express that?  In this role, I would be happy to hear more about what's going on in your home life, because more information helps me understand the overall context of how you feel.  When you have your husband or partner, you need to discuss what your wife or husband says, and decide how to move forward with their way of doing things.  Then, with your wife or husband, and your feelings about how your wife or husband feels, we need to get into the relationship, and figure out how to communicate your needs and how your wife or husband can meet those needs. It's important to take this part of your life into consideration, because we all know it's not healthy to live by yourself, and have a family. In addition to talking to your partner, you also need to discuss how you both want to talk about this. If one partner is more aggressive than the other, you may need to talk and work together to understand this new dynamic.I would also suggest the relationship between you and your wife/husband could be the topic of therapy. With the help of a professional, you might be able to communicate more openly and honestly, which would set you up for a more healthy relationship."
"As a child, my parents injured my brother, so they went to prison. I was there when he had gotten hurt, but I can't seem to remember. I also can't remember being with them quite well. It's a blur.","It's important to know that there are counselors who are trained in working with survivors of trauma and you can get help.  The ""blur"" in your memories is your brain's attempt to protect you from the experiences in your past.  To recover them can be a slow process done by a trained professional that you trust.  When you are ready and feel safe, those memories can be recovered and can be integrated with other memories.  This will help to lessen the potency of the memory, help to make sense of what has happened, and allow you to begin the healing process.  Check into therapist who are trained in EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing).","Sounds awful. I am so sorry to hear about your brother, and that his injury involved you. From what I've heard about children being in the middle of all of this, they have a tough time remembering what happened. If you were there, maybe you could help your brother, or at least say something supportive to him in the future. Don't let a hurt boy and his family be a source of you hurting from the past. Take care of yourself and make sure you get some help from someone who is in your support system so you can focus on the next step forward."
I hate everything I see in the mirror. I don't like being in pictures and always scribble out my face. It's stressing me out. I don't trust my parents enough to tell them and I don't know what to do.,"This is so very common in this crazy looks-obsessed world! I meet so many beautiful people who can't see their beauty. Is there something getting in the way for you? Was there a time in your life when people teased you or told you something hurtful, or did something to you that made you feel ugly? If so, this can be addressed first. Sometimes stories are told about us when we're young and the best thing we can do is see the author's evil or careless intent and not take that on. A therapist can help you with this part.Once you've addressed any past barriers to feeling confident, you can focus on a few simple things. First, your thoughts. If you keep telling yourself that you don't like what you see, then you will never feel okay about your looks. Experiment with telling yourself something different. Look in the mirror and I dare you to find something that's lovely about your face. Focus on that. Describe what you see? If you were your own best friend, what would you say about your face? Eliminating those negative scripts and building new positive ones will help you feel more accepting of how you look. You can't change your face, but you can change your attitude towards your face. Confidence is the things that will make you beautiful!Accepting how you look is important. Without going to plastic surgery (the popularity of which is a testimony to how nuts this whole thing has become), you were born with that nose, those eyes, those lips. Accepting yourself and knowing it won't change is a good idea, because wishing it were different won't make it so!Looking good is also about minimizing flaws and building on your assets. Are you in a rut about hairstyle or makeup? Ask a good friend to give you a make-over. Play with your features and wardrobe. There are plenty of average looking people who know how to make themselves shine because they are creative!","A mirror reflects who you are, including your flaws and your imperfections. A picture is a projection of how you are seen from an external viewpoint. As soon as you start getting frustrated with your reflection, your own self-image is reflecting back to you an even more terrible and distorted reflection. Instead of worrying about how it looks in front of people, try to see yourself as you are from the inside and how someone would describe you to you. The key thing is for us to understand that your body is your vessel and is the way you're presented to the outside world and you have some control over what people see."
"I was hanging out with my close guy friend. We started kissing, but afterwards, he said that we should just stay friends because he doesn't want to ruin anything. We both just got out of relationships. His was very sexual. I'm not a sexual person, and he knows that. I want to be with him, but I'm not ready for another relationship, and I don't know if he ever will want to be more than friends.","Given that both you and your friend recently ended your respective romantic relationships, kissing each other sounds like each of you satisfied a very natural need which for right now does not has a natural source of satisfaction.Suddenly being without a partner is difficult because a relationship absorbs and offers much of a person's energy. Stay focused on what you know about yourself, which is that you're not ready for another relationship.From what you describe about your friend, similar to you, he does not feel ready for a new relationship.If and when you feel ready to enter a new relationship and your friend seems attractive, then you'll be in a position to find out, either by approaching your friend as a potential partner, or by asking your question of his interest in you.Who knows?It is possible your friend will feel ready for a new relationship, approach you, and depending on your personal wishes to be or not be with who he has become, accept his offer.Good luck with Step One, becoming familiar with your new state of single hood, and sorting through the good news and bad news of your most recent relationship.","If you're really interested in something more than friendship, I would say that it's a good idea that you are having some sexual encounters with your friend. We all experience a level of sexual curiosity with people who we're close to. The most important thing to do is to try to get to know your friend better before deciding if you’re truly interested in building a relationship with them. A sexual encounter might be more than a little bit of curiosity for you, so it's a good idea to consider that the question of whether or not you are ready for another relationship in your life is still coming up. If so, it might be good to talk to a counselor about the relationship between you and your friend to see if there's a way to help the two of you stay friends for now."
"My mother has quite severe, undiagnosed OCD, diagnosed posttraumatic stress disorder, and maybe other mental health issues. She is weeks away from moving in with me, my husband, and our three children. I love my mother, but once she gets within her own area, she begins to tape all cracks and crevasses. She cannot tolerate any smells.","One way to handle the situation is to develop willingness to tolerate her unusual habits.  Would you be willing to talk with your kids that grandma is sensitive to smells and her way to address this is to tape up cracks and crevasses?As long as her behavior isn't aggressive, harmful to anyone, unethical or immoral, and you'd like her to live with you, then someone both sides need to be happy with the living condition.Also, if you haven't already done so, negotiate with your mom that the common family areas are off limits to taping the the cracks.  As part of adjusting to living with your family it is reasonable to expect she respect common areas and to limit her taping habit to her private sections within the house.Approach the matter fairly and with the expectation to satisfy all the people who are affected.","I can understand how you feel! It's possible that she is in pain because of the memories of your mother and your father, and this experience with your own mother has caused her to feel a sense of fear, or uncertainty. I am sure she is nervous to be in a new environment with a new family. I do hope your mother will be happy in whatever way you can create for her!   If you feel overwhelmed by the emotions you are receiving from it, you may seek the guidance of the person who has trained in you as a therapist. If you are feeling overwhelmed by your own feelings, it would make sense to seek out the support of a therapist."
I am in my 30s with 2 kids and no job and I'm behind on the bills. I've been trying everything with no results. I feel like everyone else puts their needs in front on mine. I give intil it hurts and I'm afraid that I'm going to fail my babies    I've been struggling for 5 yrs in a relationship with no communication and no alone time. How can I get some support?,"Financial stability is probably a good place to start your new life project.If your partner doesn't work or doesn't contribute his money to the household bills, then maybe you are eligible  for some type of stipend from the government.Especially since you have kids the child welfare service may intervene to help you.  Sometimes too, a partner who is unwilling to pay for their kids' wellbeing may be pressured by child welfare to make regular contributions to you and your kids.I''m glad you are thinking of your needs and those of your kids.  This is the philosophy which will show you what road to follow so all three of you are in a secure financial place.","To start, maybe you are focused on what is on the menu of your mind. The reality is that your family probably won't be the ones that provide support in this situation. I know this to be true because in the world of parenting, the role of a parent is to support their children. It is often difficult to remember that support for children comes from the family they live with. I would suggest looking to the families in your social circle. I know that many people in your area of the world may have children that need help. Your own support is important, and your kids need support. This might also give you some insight into which way to turn."
"I'm an adult, facing problems with my mom. She's way too controlling. She decides things for me, disregarding whatever I say. I tried explaining my side to her calmly, but she eventually gets angry and doesn't wish to listen to me regardless of how I speak to her.","The part of your life which is in your control is the way you handle what your mom does and the way she talks to you.It is possible the two of you have very different opinions on a great number of matters.Each person, including you, has the right to decide whether and how to respond to someone.Stick up for your own right to make decisions.If she doesn't accept your independent viewpoints, then this doesn't give away your right to have these views.Since she makes herself clear as to her unwillingness to listen to you, then consider this as an easy way to avoid directly speaking with her about what's on your mind.If she ever shows an interest in your opinions and you feel like discussing these with her, then feel free to make this choice.","Is the main issue the control is the only issue you have with her? How about the way she is able to affect your feelings towards her? You could explore her history and her fears regarding your being over her control. Why does she believe that you will do the same as she would do if you were in her place? Is there something about your mother that causes her fear to not want control over you? Sometimes controlling and overprotective behaviors are caused from fear of abandonment and loss of control, particularly in the mother-child relationship. It doesn't necessarily mean she doesn't love you; her fear is about the potential for you to not want her, to not be in her thoughts or influence. You can tell her that you are happy to have a relationship and that you don't want her control over your feelings or choices. In addition, what kind of messages are you receiving from her regarding your decision to do what you want to do in your life? Does she feel that the decisions you make have any impact on her? If you are not being reassured by her support that you are in charge of your life, you're likely experiencing confusion and a lack of emotional support. Explore how your mother's behavior and/or her words affect you and you can talk to her, and see if she can communicate that her fears are getting in the way of your feelings and your independence."
"She's busy because her mom makes her clean all the time and go out places with her family. We don't talk much because of it. Also, we have little fights. We want to work it out but we don't know how.","Maybe you can start with having 15 minutes per week that you know you will be spending time with each other (even if it needs to be on the phone). Because this much time could be scheduled ahead of time, at least you would know there was that time that was set aside. That may also help you to rekindle some conversations between you.As far as your little fights, consider spending five minutes with one of you talking about one issue that is a concern and the other partner asking questions that are open-ended (cannot be answered with just yes or no) and listening as an investigative reporter to try to learn more about what the other person is experiencing. Then, once the partner who started speaking thinks the listening partner is understanding where they are coming from, switch. It's also good to restate what you think you are hearing. Then you know what each other is truly following about this. Also remember that following or understanding what someone is saying does not imply agreement, just that you are recognizing what they are saying and able to see where they are coming from.Also consider noticing what makes you feel valued, special, loved, or appreciated. Think of the same for your girlfriend. This could be a great discussion to have as well.","Hi there, I'm sad about that to hear and understand that you don't really talk to your mom because there are so many barriers that are making it hard for you to work through this. At first, it might be nice to get it off your chest and it will feel like it is something that you can turn into something for the two of you to work on together. It feels bad for you to talk to your mom that you don't talk to her and you're stuck. When you work on communication problems, it gets much better for both of you. How to start is that you first talk to your mom that you want to talk about what feels like a problem. When you talk to your mom that you want to talk about, let her know that you are willing to work with her on her communication to help you get to a better place on your way. At first, you may be angry or frustrated, and that's okay. You have the right to be, but you don't have to be angry. Once you're not angry, you can then have a productive conversation with her about the situation."
How do I stop those thoughts?,"The thoughts you are having are just thoughts.  Not actions.  It is your choice whether you act on these thoughts.  If you decide to explore having sex with adults of different genders that is great.  If you find yourself obsessed with sexual thoughts, you may want to see a cognitive-behavioural therapist.  Take care.",In therapy this has the following answers: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.
"My fiancée suffers from severe anxiety and depression. She has had it most of her life. Her anxiety in public places is the worst. It gets to points where she can't breathe or move. Sometimes, she won't even go to the restroom, so she will hold in her pee until her stomach hurts or she pees herself. She curls up in corners at the mall and has panic attacks. She won't eat or drink in public. If she isn't having a panic attack or crying, she's clinging to me and avoiding everything and everyone. Her depression flares up out of nowhere and causes her to become very suicidal and self-harming. She get really sick from anxiety and scared to the point that I can't even get her to eat, drink, leave the bed, or go outside. She always tells me how she grew up around so much fighting and fear that it makes her scared of loud sounds, yelling, conflict, and even talking to strangers in public. She will refuse to go to a store unless I am with her to talk to the cashier for her. She is so scared that I can't even get her to drive. She doesn't want to get her license because she's scared of trying to drive.
   Some people have recommended medication, but I believe it's just going to cover up her illness and not solve it. I don't want my fiancée pumped with drugs. I believe a psychiatric service dog would be the best bet for her. When we first met my poodle, it would calm her down a lot. She took the dog out every time we went out, and she seemed much calmer and happier. She slowly would eat, and the dog seemed to make her feel a lot better. I am worried and want to help her without medication.","It sounds like you have been a positive support for your fiancee. There is no doubt that this situation is a great challenge for the both of you. While it may feel like you are responsible for her health and happiness, it is important that you understand that you, on your own, won't be able to resolve her mental health issues. Based on what you have explained, it sounds like she needs to get a medical and/or psychiatric evaluation. Whether or not she decides to take medication is her (and your) decision, but keeping an open mind about treatment options is important. I suggest that she see a therapist on her own in order to better understand and cope with her anxiety and depression, especially given her suicidal thoughts. You would also likely benefit from therapy, individual or couple's therapy, in order to address how you are feeling and best learn how to support her and your relationship. I wish the very best for both of you and hope that things will improve sooner than later.","Your friend is right in that medications are just covering for the symptom. You and your fiancee will need to go into a psychiatrists service dog! However, I think the goal is to have a companion that provides some level of comfort and connection to someone who experiences many challenges with anxiety. Your friend gave you an amazing insight in that if she had a service dog, she would likely feel much more comfortable and in control of her anxiety. Also, having a person that is not an emotional support type of person, could become an emotional support type of person for your friend."
"I panicked over a minor parking lot mistake. It was totally my fault, but due to another insurance issue, I left a note with an illegible phone number. Guilty over this, I got an envelope containing several hundred dollars. Unfortunately, by the time I returned, the other driver had seen my ersatz note and drove away. Since I cannot make this up to that individual, how do I atone for my cowardly act? I have been trying to do random acts of kindness in hopes that karma will somehow even out.","From your writing, you have already atoned for what you describe as ""cowardly"".Recognizing your action and trying to directly correct it, realizing your action was improper and demonstrating the willingness to take right action, are all examples of making things right.Since the actual driver is unavailable to consult as to their wishes on what they expect and feel would correct the matter, you did the next best thing and considered the situation from the driver point of view.","Since you have a moral obligation to correct an error and not be cowardly. I suggest you send the person a sincere, heartfelt email that you will turn in your car to the police about this matter. Let them handle the situation."
"I stress over everything. If I don't have enough ""quality time"" with my boyfriend, I start to feel resentment towards him. He has three children, and they are great kids, but I find we don't have much time together. I break down easily and find myself depressed.","Everyone has some level of anxiety - it's what helps us respond to stressors in our lives and clues us into the fact that we need to respond to something going on. However, if you're feeling overwhelmed by racing thoughts, feeling like you spend a lot of energy worrying about something specific or even pretty much anything at all, and you're starting to find that it's getting in your way when it comes to living your life the way you want, then I'd suggest seeing a counselor or therapist for an assessment for anxiety. Your other concerns, though, seem pretty ""normal"" for someone who is in a relationship with a partner who has children. As a married stepmother, I've been there, and as a therapist, I can tell you that the boundaries and communication skills you have in your relationships need to be healthy for you to feel healthy. Finding some support from a group of others whose partners have children might be really helpful - being able to hear from others that you aren't alone in feeling like this can really lighten the load, and they might have some good ideas for handling certain situations. Another option is to find a counselor or therapist who has experience working with step/blended family dynamics - because even if you're not officially married, those dynamics come into play whenever there are kids from another relationship involved. You may even consider couples counseling so that both of you can learn to talk about your relationship needs and concerns in a way that will encourage connection and strengthen your sense of partnership.","You said, ""I stress over everything"". I'm glad you said this. It means you worry a lot more about things than other people. I have the same problem, my mom always tells me that I need to think about the little things and I never do. I'm also told that I need to be patient with myself.  What makes you so insecure about what your friends and the people you don't know think about you? Also, you said that ""If I don't have enough ""quality time"" with my boyfriend, I start to feel resentment towards him. In other words, I feel resentful when I don't have enough time with your boyfriend. I know this sounds silly to you, but you feel it and I do too... How do you feel when you don't feel resentful with your boyfriend? It can change things about how you do and what we do together.You mentioned you ""break down easily"". What causes these breakdowns? Are there certain times of the year when that is more likely to happen? Also, what do you do when you feel this way? Do you call the boyfriend, and discuss this and if possible get something that works for both of you? Or do you just feel upset with your boyfriend and it seems to make things worse? I can think of a few things that may work for you. For one, you might try to listen with an open mind and try and understand why you have resentment with your boyfriend. What is bothering you? Then you can try to talk to your boyfriend about what is going on.   And if the other thing is that you feel resentful with your boyfriend, then you can try to set an out of sight time with him. This might take some time, and you need to show him that you are sure to do it. Then you can work on the problem, that you need more quality time with him.    I don't know if your girlfriend would want you to use these suggestions, as some of them would be to take care of yourself. I think it is best if you communicate directly with your girlfriend. What about you? What do you think the reason would be that you are feeling resentment to him? Is it about how much time you both spend together? Is it about you feeling insecure because your boyfriend is good at everything and you don't feel good about yourself? Or is it something else?I would recommend you read some books about self-esteem, confidence"
What makes a healthy marriage last?,"This is a fantastic question. In one sentence, I would say the following:Recognize that while you and your partner probably have common interests and areas of commonality, you are separate people, each with different wants, wishes, and desires – if you consider a diagram of two overlapping circles, they may share perhaps a third of the circle with overlap to indicate commonality (could be more or less) and then there are parts of the circles that are not overlapping, indicating separate interestsAs for ways that may strengthen any relationship, even the great ones, this is what came to mind. There are certainly more specific unique answers or elements for different people as far as the details, but here are some general ideas:Try to have at least 15 minutes a week where you are spending time together and not problem-solvingRealize that listening to your partner does not mean that you are agreeing with them, it just means that you are saying that you hear where they are coming fromLearn to hold on to your own wants, wishes, and desires while also recognizing those of your partnerSet boundaries for what is and isn't acceptable behavior during an argument or difficult discussionDiscuss how having important discussions can be anxiety-producing and consider having an understanding that if one of you (or both of you) feels overwhelmed, you can take a timeout for a certain amount of time. For example, you may say ""okay, I'm feeling really stressed about this right now. Let's discuss it in an hour."" And at that time, go back to the discussionConsider what your partner's top three or four complaints about you may be. Check in with them and see how accurate you are. If you see validity in their responses, consider whether or not you may want to make changesDiscover what makes your partner feel loved, valued, appreciated, or specialRelationships are always in progress and constantly changing. Some anxiety around change is typical. Being able to effectively discuss the anxiety and actually listen to one another without being defensive, name calling, finger-pointing, or asking each other to change is a true gift.You may enjoy this quote: ""Connection is the energy that is created between people when they feel seen, heard, and valued; when they can give and receive without judgment."" ~Brene Brown","You can't help me!

"Now that the other girl is out of the picture, our sex life isn't the same. Is it because he is still thinking about the other girl?",Or...better yet... Is it you still thinking about the other girl?  I am sure his cheating hurt you emotionally and may have affected your sexual performance as well.  Make sure the other girl is out the picture on your end as well.  Sounds like something the both of you need to have a calm and adult conversation about.,"I have no evidence to say that he is doing so, so I don't know. I wish you luck with that."
I feel like my time is going too fast,"Thank you for reaching out! That is a great question! As an American, I can truly say that I spend way too much time on the go! It is a proven fact that Americans live in a fast paced environment compared to Europe! I often ask myself, what if I only had one day left on this Earth? What would I do? Well, that is an easy question. I would spend it with my family! Easier said than done when we are living in a tomorrow kind of World, right? Its hard to focus on the now when we are so consumed in what tomorrow shall bring.Time management is a very important factor when learning to ""live life to the fullest""! In fact, this is a required course in undergraduate college now. Everyone manages their time differently and it is up to you to decide how you would like to do this. Personally, for myself I like to keep a calendar with a to-do list. I always place my most important tasks at the top of the list. That way, if I do not get through the list, I am not stressing over the little things. When planning your day, it is important you schedule work, eat and play. A much as it is hard not to work after getting off work, it must be done. There is discipline involved in this process. If you have trouble with this, then maybe seeking out some accountability such as including a coworker to make sure you do not bring work home once your shift is over or your spouse/partner reminding you that this is a time for play and not work.These are just some ideas that I am throwing out there. Again, everyone has their own style on time management. I hope this was helpful for you. Please don't hesitate to reach out for anything further!","That’s amazing, and, quite frankly, probably correct. ""Time"" is a measure of the amount of *time* that has passed, and we do not know for sure whether it is moving backwards or forwards! Is your perception of the passage of time accurate?"
"I’m in a relationship with my child's father. I’m a really jealous person. We don’t go out or do anything with other people because of me. To keep our relationship going, I know I have to stop being jealous, but I can’t. How can I get over these issues?","It may be important to look at this as getting through something rather than ""getting over it."" If you're aware of the reasons why you are jealous, I don't know if they relate to this relationship or a previous one, but you could remind yourself of the differences if your feelings of jealousy relate to something from your past.Also, it may be beneficial to have a conversation with your child's father if you are both open to having a discussion about this in a way that you summarize what each other is saying so you are sure that you are understanding each other, at least to some degree.Also, consider what you may want from your child's father to assist you with this. You cannot make him do anything to support you with this, but you can certainly ask.What is something you could start or stop doing to move you toward your goal?","You are asking a good question. Your question is very common. As you have noticed, I have often heard people ask this same question ""How can I get over these issues?"" and to the question ""Do you have a choice?"" I feel that the answer is no.   No one has a choice! The choice you have is the desire to stop these feelings, to stop feeling jealous and to be happy! So how can you stop feeling jealous? The answer is you must get over the feelings! You have to take control of your feelings. You can't use another person's happiness and life to try to feel better about your own situation. I've worked with many people who had the same feelings!  They said that they started going to therapists and practicing relaxation techniques. They said that they began thinking about how their life would be if they stopped being jealous and what would their new life be like. Eventually, their jealousy faded as their thoughts shifted towards positivity and gratitude. Also, you can ask yourself why you're jealous. Where have you learned to feel this way?  Was there a time when you felt disappointed, or hurt, and in response felt jealous?  When you think about those times, you realize what you learned.  By understanding that jealousy is a common emotion, that it is usually rooted in feelings of inadequacy and insecurity, and that you can choose to address those feelings instead of feeling jealous, you can be able to change your own feelings."
"My daughter was overly tired and throwing a fit at her grandparent's house. She wanted to come home at midnight and cried screamed said she said she hated her grandma and that she wanted to kill herself!
    We also have a new baby in the house i didn't know if this would contribute to this. How should I approach this?","You wrote a very full family context w many directions to examine.Do you know or can you find out what the grandma and your daughter were doing in the evening of the screaming episode?Is it possible the grandma abuses your daughter, or tells her scary stories, watches scary movies.  These are only suggestions of some problem between grandma and your daughter.Also, ask your daughter directly why she wants to kill herself and what' killing herself"" means.   Seven year olds don't have a concept of death being a forever condition.  Seven year olds don't have a sense of future meaning besides liking/disliking them.   Maybe the new baby is a factor.  Do you feel this is a factor?   Trust your intuition to tell you if your daughter is resentful of your new baby.Even if she is, I doubt a seven year old has the capacity to connect current unhappiness with the intention of a future action, including suicide.","It's completely understandable that you're both getting frustrated and worried, it's ok to have a good time with your own kids but you also have to think about them! Her age may mean this is not a new situation. In the meantime, here are a few ideas:

A simple conversation, with both of you, may be helpful. If he says that he hates his grandma, you may want to talk to him about that, but without labeling him, you are also teaching him about how to deal with difficult situations in the future. Then go from there. At your level, you may not be able to completely understand how she is feeling if she is not speaking about it, but you will have a better understanding by hearing the facts of what she has been saying. As a therapist, you can help him cope with whatever feelings come up and also, you can give her additional support. 

If this child is happy with your and this new baby, this may be a sign that the family dynamic is in harmony and this is the right direction!"
"I don't know how to have emotions. I never had any from my birth. Being human, I think of myself as a monster. I enjoy pain. I cut myself for my climax during sex. I think most of the time, I lie, even when sometimes it would have been easy just to tell the truth. I was in rehabilitation for four year. I have made love with both men and women, but it made no impact in my emotions. The books that I enjoy reading H.P. Lovecraft and Edgar Allen Poe. I go hunting every Saturday. I feel powerful. I don't enjoy the killing of the creature, but the hunt of it and to eat and drink the flesh and blood of the creature.","I'm not sure that you don't feel emotion or that you are frightened of the depth of your emotions. From what you write, the context of your growing up years had people telling you to not feel.  Little kids and babies don't remember whether or not they had emotions since birth.  This is information someone told you or was part of your family system.Possibly your family was afraid of their emotions or of you knowing yours.Similarly, your comparison of being human means being monster like, is not an obvious connection.  Besides, monsters are an idea, they aren't real.  They embody what someone considers the worst qualities of themselves or the human species.  Again, I wonder whether you've taken on stories you heard growing up about how unacceptable and bad you are.A way to start learning your emotions is to start in simple, basic ways to ask yourself what you are feeling in the situations that you believe emotions would belong.If on the first bright sunny and warm day of the year, you remind yourself to notice what you're feeling in response to this, you'll be taking one step toward awareness of your emotions.If someone buys you a birthday present, be aware of how you feel.  Keep adding awareness to situations and see if this builds an ease with feeling emotions.","I have read you online and it feels to me that you are trying to ""get away from all the negative emotions."" Perhaps some good ideas that can come out of that are that your emotions are there for a reason...and perhaps you can learn to feel them more for the sake of not suppressing them...but learning to live with the more negative ones without needing the help of others. I have had my own issues with emotional repression. I have a habit of taking the good out of situations and acting out on my emotions in a way that hurts people I care about. I have learned that the ""good"" I get out of the situation are my own...so that it doesn't hurt me personally. Also, I have learned that taking advantage of your own emotional needs to get what you want is only a cycle of pain. You need to find what is a sustainable way to get your needs met without having to use your emotion to get them."
"He's been losing feelings and he doesn't know why. I love him very very much. He sometimes thinks I'm obsessed when I'm not at all. I give him his space and I make sure he's okay but sometimes I think if me and him saw each other more it would be better? I truly want me and him to get better, it's kind of hard not to stress about it, because the love of my life is losing feelings which is a sad feeling. He's a great guy! I just don't know why he's been losing feelings towards me. He's starting to put less effort in talking to me. At this point I'll do anything to just make us better as a couple. I tried talking to him but he doesn't like talking about it much. Advice on what to do?","I'm willing to bet that this isn't what you are hoping to hear, but I'd suggest giving him space. Ooph, that's a tough one, right?! I know. But here's the thing, when you keep trying to process and talk it out with him you keep pushing him away. He needs to feel like a solid and whole person (as you do too) to be able to be fully in your relationship. It's the work of being in relationship to learn this. I get that this is tough stuff. I wonder, outside of being with him, how do you soothe and calm yourself? That's the stuff for you to tune into and focus on right now.",Since I don't have the ability to know his reason for not wanting to talk about his feelings I'll ask if he is talking to other women and has a couple of interesting conversations happening with them! Do you believe he has a good sense of what his own feelings are? If so I think we can figure out how to figure out if he feels like you're taking in and holding on to his feelings. As a therapist myself I sometimes get people in which way to keep talking so the others will stop talking to them. This comes at some cost but if the relationship is important it may be worth the cost.
"My boyfriend won't touch me intimately, he won't kiss me while we are having sex and he won't have oral sex with me. I know he has done this things with other women in the past. I don't know why he won't do them with me. What should I do?","First off, don't blame yourself or be too quick to jump to any scary conclusions.  Human sexuality can be incredibly complex at times (e.g., what turns us on at one time may not be what turns us on the next time). There could actually be a number of things going on including him having performance anxiety...maybe he had a bad experience with a previous partner that's left him scared to try again (we call this operant conditioning).  It could also be that he puts you in a different category than previous lovers.  Sometimes I refer to this as the ""hooker-housewife mentality"" where a partner somehow gets the idea that when we truly fall in love, we treat that one differently; almost up on a pedestal.  Drives many partners crazy until they're aware that this is going on and give their boyfriend/ girlfriend permission to enjoy both the naughty and the nice with them. It could also be that he's not even aware that he's not doing these things. If you haven't asked him yet, you might try gently approaching the subject when you're not already in the bedroom or trying to get in on and inquire what he most enjoys about sex with you (or has enjoyed in the past, or thinks he might enjoy).  You can also share your favorite highlights of sex with him.  Give him an ego boost and tell him what he does well while then asking him if he'd be down to go downtown.  ""Baby, it REALLY turns me on when you kiss me during sex.""If you continue to get the impression that it's somehow only about YOU or that he's just really hesitant to talk about sex in general, you might see if he'd be cool to chat with a counselor who specializes in sexual intimacy.","This sounds like a red flag of shame, lack of attention or perhaps fear for your sense of self. Your pain will grow larger if he doesn't offer you that level of intimacy and attention.  �������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������"
Sometimes 3 times a night.,"Perhaps more dreaming means that you are making use of your mind to solve problems.  I find that change states, while sometimes difficult, are very exciting.  They give you opportunity to grow more rapidly.  So I say: ""congratulations!""  ~Mark (www.MarkMorrisLCSW.com and www.LivingYes.org)","The 3x3 journaling can give more focus on your 3x3 journaling. Maybe you should pick 3 things that you want to focus on. Then write down the three things you are working on.  At the end of your journal, think about what you learned.  Then write down 3 things you have done in order to be better.  Maybe one thing you could learn, one thing you want to learn, and one thing you want to do so.  It is easy to feel overwhelmed because you should think of 3000 things that you want to accomplish.  It's okay to have all the thoughts and emotions in here. But write down 3 things in the next 3 days!  The most interesting thing of all is that you start to write for a few weeks and then you get tired of writing.  But you still end up writing for three times a night and that is great!  You've just found what works for you.  Then you can probably work with that to become more productive in general."
I shake and have panic attacks.,"One way to understand panic attacks is as a sign of feeling insecure or lacking confidence in a certain area or characteristic of yourself.The insecurity can sometimes feel overwhelming and this starts the sense of panic. One way to build your sense of security within yourself is to have a simple life and a slow paced life.   When there are many activities or involvements to pay attention, then it is easy to not give full attention to all of them.  This may trigger a sense of insecurity since in fact you may not have had sufficient time to study and know your own opinion about all of what your life is immersed in.A simpler life of fewer activities allows more time to know and understand your own inner feelings and reactions.To know more about yourself may help build your confidence and security in your ability to know and live what goes on in your life!","What I can tell you may have a variety of contributing factors to panic attacks. If you start to feel you need to contact a doctor I would strongly recommend that you do that. But here are some things that you can do that are not medications (such as antidepressants) that may be helpful for you.

1. Have a warm, comfortable and safe environment.
2. Practice relaxation techniques.
3. Try a breathing-based technique (I would recommend the 4-7-8 breathing technique).
4. Have a partner who you can talk to.
5. Remember that it is okay to have panic attacks and that you are not alone.

I hope this information is helpful and that you're in touch with a healthcare professional as soon as possible."
"My boyfriend and I have a toxic relationship due to his emotional and verbal abuse but he makes me feel like I could never find someone better, and that I can't be happy without him.
   How do I get away from this relationship?","I'm glad you recognize your own best interest and that your life will be much better without verbal and emotional abuse.One of the terrible results of being abused in a relationship which is expected to be loving, safe and supportive, is that the one who is being abused, starts to question their own judgement, rights, opinions, overall way of thinking.This happens because partners who are intimately involved with one another are very meaningful.  Regardless of how irrational, wrong, mean, selfish, intimidating, thoughtless, a partner is to the other, the person on the receiving side gradually starts questioning whether they are wrong for not accepting these sorts of interactions.Stick with what your own intuition tells you.There is a part within each of us which knows the truth of what is going on.Leaving a relationship is always difficult to some degree.  People are in familiar patterns of daily behavior, no one wants to suddenly ""be alone"", even if this only means showing up as a physical body, not as a truly loving partner, no one wants to start telling others about a breakup, answer questions about it, feel blamed, worry what others think.These are secondary matters to following the truth in your own heart.Listen to yourself about leaving this guy. Your inner self does not lie to you.","I am sorry to hear about your issues in your relationship with your boyfriend. It is true that you are told you will never find someone better and that you can't be happy without him. This is true for many people who have been victimized by a cruel and abusive partner. If you are in a relationship where there is no respect, love, or safety for you, it is reasonable to feel like you want out of the relationship. However, I also want to state that it is not always possible to leave a toxic relationship. One may have feelings of not wanting to leave from their boyfriend. In this case, they may want to start by asking his girlfriend for a break-up plan. If the only way to get away from the abuse would be to stay in the relationship is to get out, then you may need to see a therapist. If you want to work with a therapist at the same time as the relationship, you can say you need to set a date to meet with them so you both know when you can get away from one another. One will always be there for his girlfriend. After the breakup, there is often a brief period where either one is angry. You must also consider whether you would be happy with a divorce in the future. Some people enjoy divorce. You can also decide what to do with your assets and where you would like to live.  It is important to note that you are not alone in the situation that is happening with you and you may be able to get help from family and friends who you trust."
"My husband and I had our first threesome recently. Everyone was drinking and he was on her more then me.    He and I talked about it afterwards and it made me feel better, and now I'm craving more of it. But before it gets close to happening I get this empty feeling. Why am I feeling this way?","As someone who specializes in sexuality and polyamory, I can tell you that your experience is incredibly common. It can be helpful to keep in mind that alcohol lowers our inhibitions, and for first time threesomes or any new sexual behavior really, we humans tend to enjoy a little extra oomph to our courage levels. That being said, it also lowers our ability to make well thought-out decisions. This combined with the brain rewarding novelty (new lover, new experience with our partner etc.) and maybe even some over-zealousness and performance anxiety could likely explain why your husband was on her more than you. My encouragement to you is to try not to overthink it at this stage. Now, IF you two choose to bring her or someone else into the bedroom again and a similar thing keeps happening, I would definitely push the issue and see what's up from his perspective.The empty feeling could be any number of things including:Fear that ""you're not enough for him""Fear that ""she's better than you"" in some wayFear that ""if we keep doing this thing, he will need it and what happens if I no longer want it?""Opposite fear of ""what if I now want her more than him"" or ""if I want the threesomes and he doesn't?""Fear of ""does this mean our sex life isn't good enough as it is?""....""do we have to always add a little spice to keep it hot?""Or like Robin alluded to, preconceived notions about what culture, religion, family and friends etc. say about what marriage and sex ""should"" look like.  I also agree with her encouragement to explore the empty feeling further and see what nuances of other feelings are in there...jealousy? insecurity? shame? regret? longing?  When you can identify and name them, they are easier handled. Some of the resources I recommend poly/ sexually open couples are:“Love in Abundance: a Counselor’s Advice on Open Relationships” by Kathy Labriola“The Jealousy Workbook: Exercises and Insights for Managing Open Relationships” by Kathy Labriola“Rewriting the Rules: an Integrative Guide to Love, Sex, and Relationships” by Meg Barker“More Than Two: a Practical Guide to Ethical Polyamory” by Franklin Veaux & Eve Rickert“The Game Changer: a Memoir of Disruptive Love” by Franklin Veaux“The Ethical Slut: a Practical Guide to Polyamory, Open Relationships, and Other Adventures” by Dossie Easton & Janet Hardy“Opening Up: a Guide to Creating and Sustaining Open Relationships” by Tristan Taormino“Open All the Way: Confessions From my Open Marriage” by Sadie Smythe“Henry and June: From ‘A Journal of Love’ – The Unexpurgated Diary of Anais Nin (1931-1932)“Personally, I find your cravings to be healthy and quite normal. The key is to make them work well for you and your partner(s). Robin's also right about communication being key. Some of the suggested resources above can help get those conversations started. And if you need further assistance, absolutely I would find a sex-positive, poly-positive counselor to chat with.Best of luck to you!Tamara Powell, LMHC","You sound like a woman with a lot to live for, a lot of experience that comes with a woman in a relationship.  There are several things that can cause you to feel this way.  You might be craving more pleasure or pleasure and you are seeking that. Your feelings are understandable and valid.  If you are feeling this way, it's really good that you have had the chance to talk about it. Talking about your feelings and what they mean is important, so that you are aware of what's going on. Also, talk to your husband and let him know what your feelings and thoughts have been. He may already be aware of what is going on with you and can help to ensure that you get the same things you need, which is important for your relationship. If there are issues in your relationship that have to do with pleasure, your love, or your needs, those issues could be a cause for your unhappiness. If those issues are addressed, then you may feel better in your relationship."
"I never feel like myself. I can’t even think straight anymore. I start stuttering and I can’t remember anything. I always get nervous and usually talk myself down but recently end up fighting with, what feels like, someone else. I don’t know why I feel this way, but I hate it.","Hi Houston, Okay, something's definitely going on, right? My gut is to start with your family physician, because you have some physical symptoms. While it seems anxiety is a likely problem here, your doctor will hopefully know your history and can help you decide if you need some medical tests or some therapy. Without knowing more, that's all I can say at this point. Best of luck.","You've also been feeling anxious again. Since your symptoms have been occurring for a long time, you are likely feeling trapped and unable to take any real steps to improve your mental state. I also would like to point out that a lot of people feel like this at times. Many things can make this feel like you have not found yourself in the life you want. Many things happen over our lifetimes. For example, if you live in a very abusive home, you have a very good reason to feel very anxious and afraid for your safety. It can also lead to many more problems in a person's life. One of the most common anxieties is a fear of failure. You're still struggling with finding a good career. And you fear that you don't belong here, to achieve your goals or to be successful. You are thinking about your past life, and you're afraid you can't change it. You feel ashamed to be anxious. This is not good. It's a symptom of something more. So be proud of the fact that you are here to listen and start to have a more meaningful conversation. It might be helpful to have some of your specific past experiences discussed, and then to decide what type of future you want to make it and work towards this vision together. Good luck."
"The sounds of eating and breathing gives me headaches—mostly mouth breathing and snoring. It makes me angry, and I want to solve it myself.","Probably good to know in what type of situations you are, in which you are hearing mouth breathing and snoring.If you're sleeping beside your partner who does these actions, would have a different response than if you overhear mouth breathing and snoring from a family member who is napping on the couch and you are walking past them on your way to take a snack in the kitchen.Basically, if the person who does these actions which bother you, start by telling them.Depending on whether they are empathetic to how distressed you are from their sounds, or not, willing to change, or not, has a good deal to do with next steps.I don't really see any step you're able to take to solve that you are sensitive to human sounds from the head.One path I don't recommend is expecting yourself to ignore the fact of being feeling bothered, or dismissing your own sensitivity someone.Your needs matter.","I'd be willing to help you explore that, but first I think you should see an ENT doctor. I would describe that to the doctor as a new, and persistent headache. Most of my patients do that too, but without knowing whether they are in pain, they won't be able to determine what is causing it to be a new symptom. If I was the doctor, I would be sure to do a lot of tests to figure out the cause of the headaches to find a way to make you less aware of it. Also, I'd encourage you to track when and where you feel the headaches, and try to identify any possible triggers or patterns."
"A girl and I were madly in love. We dated for over a year and were even talking about marriage and future plans together. She moved away for school, and we attempted a long distance relationship. We eventually broke up. It's been a year now, and I still haven't lost my feelings for her. I still love her the same way I did. I've suffered from depression ever since the breakup and have been unable to connect with anyone else. It's damaging me and my life.","Hi Boise, I'm sorry that you've lost this love. The fact that you were planning marriage and a future tells me that you meant something very special to each other at that time. It's different now...you're not together anymore, but you can't accept this, right? Good for you for identifying that this situation is damaging your life. You've been grieving for longer than you were together. Oh, but really you've not been grieving...you're stuck still loving her instead of moving forward. Unrequited love is a recipe for eternal heartache. Let's look at some possible blocks to moving forward.It could be that there's something unfinished for you. Maybe you felt hurt and you didn't have the chance to say so, or you felt you hurt her and you didn't have the chance to make it right. Maybe there's a burning question you need to ask or something else you need to say. Maybe you want to tell her you've never stopped loving her, and see if she feels the same way. If this is the case, you have two choices, right? You can reach out and say what you need to say, or you can stop ruminating on that question and let it go. If you reach out, there's no guarantee it will go well or that she'll even respond. Maybe write her a letter and don't send it (or send it...it might be worth the risk). Use the next paragraph to help you decide. Do you know how she feels? How did it end? Did she end it? Was it ended just because of the distance, or are there more differences between you that didn't work? Sometimes people are so in love that they can't clearly see that the other person isn't in love with them anymore. Use the information you have about what she wants for her life...can you honour what she says she needs? If she's asked for distance, you would do well to honour that.A key to moving forward: look at your thoughts and where they're getting stuck. Write it down. What bad thing can happen if you let it go? Or ""If I move forward, that will mean...""  Keep going...what would be the worst part of that?  This kind of exploring can help you identify your stuck place.It is possible that you've turned this ending into some kind of negative meaning about you or your future. As in ""If this person doesn't love me, then I'm unlovable"", or ""No one will ever love me as much as she did"". So your need to cling to her in your heart is your way of rejecting that negative message about yourself or the future. Can you find another way to reject that message? Try saying these things to yourself:I know she loved me. There is evidence of that.I was a good partner. There is evidence of that.It's part of life to fall in love and then have to move forward...I can do this and learn from it.Many people like me...that's how I know I'm lovable.It's normal to feel sad. I'm grieving a lost love.I want to move forward and not stare in the rearview mirror.I know more love awaits me if I can get fear out of the way.If this person loved me, others can too, (but not if I'm clinging to some old memory)These are the kinds of things a therapist would explore with you. I wish you well!","As you know, this feeling of ""missing them"" is very common when a relationship ends, and for you it is the ""missing them"" of a deep connection. When the relationship you're missing is one that has an impact on your emotional state and you don't know why you feel it so strongly, that can be scary.  You feel like you're missing them, or like everything will be worse without them.  The most important thing to understand is that you may be missing this in other ways.   You may be missing the comfort, the support, the shared values, the laughter or the history together with her.  You may have been missing things within yourself in the relationship that you feel missing now.  Most people are missing something in their lives when they have a relationship that ends with them.  The real question is: What is it that you are missing?  Ask yourself what your needs were in the relationship and are now fulfilled?  Is the relationship itself the problem, or are there other parts to the relationship such as: <br>  You've told me the people have moved away, the relationships has shifted...  Did you meet these people?  Will they be able to fulfill the needs you had in the relationship?   There are things that you can do to look closer at yourself, what do you need in a relationship?    It's important to remember that you are not missing anything here, because there are other sources to be happy with.    There are good parts of your life that you can find in your friends, family, hobbies, etc., that are full of joy and a great connection with your inner self.    You would have been so happy with her, and it's good to know that she felt that way about you.    \r\n"
"I met the first man five months ago. I have come a long way and do have feelings for him. I know he would do anything for me and my kids. The man I love is their father, and no matter how many times things haven't been great in the past, I can't help but love him. I know they both love me, and I love both of them.","The answer depends entirely on which interest is stronger for you.If the reliable caretaker man is not someone with whom you'd have fun, lively conversations, understand each other, be sexually compatible, or romantically attracted, and your primary interest is in someone who' steadily manage the kids, household, and finances, then he is the right one for you!The problem is you may not be happy longterm with someone to whom you feel no romantic compatibility. Consider the drawback if you reach the moment of restlessness romantically and are with someone on whom you depend to take care of your kids.Since you have feelings for him, then wait several months longer to see whether or not you can imagine yourself romantically happy with the steady guy.If the other guy who is also the bio dad, isn't involved with his own kids, then he seems like a poor choice of someone to be with longterm.","Love is a wonderful thing.I suggest you ask him for more details of the past in the hopes that you'll learn if he is still in love with you, or if that love will change as he has matured. Good luck. Love is good for you."
"She constantly tells me what I am doing wrong. For once, I want her to be proud of me. It’s like no matter what I do, she does not have one nice word to say to me. She is always hateful towards me and always has been.","I imagine this is very difficult and confusing for you.It sounds like there are things for which you are proud of yourself, which is really good. I hope there are also other people in your life that are currently able to recognize the good things that you're doing.If you think your mom would be willing to go to see a local mental health professional with you, that may be a good place to have some discussions about the relationship that the two of you have. The reason I'm suggesting that it may be easier to have the conversations there is because sometimes the mental health professional can point out parts of conflict that are not easy for the people who are involved to actually see by themselves.If you want to try to talk with you mom to see how she is feeling, maybe she would be willing to discuss it with you. If you're going to have a conversation like that, I would suggest you try these things:Ask her if this would be a good time to have an important conversation. If she says no, consider asking her when would be a better time.Try to have the conversation with the goal of taking about five minutes to learn more about where she is coming from on this. If you can ask questions to learn more about that, you may be able to know more about what she is thinking and feeling.This doesn't mean that you have to agree with her, but just that you are able to hear where she is coming from.Try to ask questions that start with the words who, what, how, where, when. Questions that start with the word ""why"" can be difficult to answer and can lead to a lot of extra emotion.Try to summarize what she is saying to see if you have it right.If you want your mom to know how you feel, after you can listen to what she is saying and see if she is willing to listen to what you would like to say.If you're going to tell your mom about how you feel, consider having some points written down ahead of time so you can explain yourself the way that you want to.It will probably be really hard to listen to her without being defensive right away. I know I would be wanting to jump right into the conversation. Remember that jumping in right away will probably make it more difficult to learn where your mom is coming from.Also, if she says she doesn't want to have a conversation, remember that she has that choice.If your mom does not want to go to see a counselor with you, remember that you could go on your own. Depending on your state and exactly how old you are, you may need your parent's permission to be in treatment, but not always. If you need help to figure that out, try contacting a couple of local mental health agencies to see if they can help you figure out what to do if you want to talk to someone.","This sounds like a very frustrating and unpleasant experience for you. When you start getting told that you are doing wrong by a family member, what is the most helpful way to approach this situation?"
"My doctor thinks that seeing a psychiatrist will help with my depression and anxiety. Now my anxiety is worse, what do I do? Writing on here has taken every bit of strength I have left.","Did you take the medication the way the psychiatrist prescribed it?  Did you follow up with her/him to report how it was going?  Different medications work differently with different people.   It's not always the first one that helps.  And some of the medications take some time to have an effect.  Give the doctor the chance to help you. I suggest you find a certified CBT therapist to help you examine your thinking.  www.AcademyofCT.org has listings of the finest CBT clinicians.  In the meantime, do some ""anxiety fasting"" by taking a few minutes to do something nice for yourself right now.  I hope you feel better soon.  ~Mark (www.MarkMorrisLCSW.com and www.LivingYes.org)","I hope you find your doctor's advice helpful too.   If your anxiety is worse now that you're going to a psychiatrist, perhaps it would be useful to discuss what you think will work best for you to help calm your anxiety.  I am sure your doctor will give some good advice on you.  I know it's hard and scary to ask for help in this way, but sometimes it is the most wonderful thing we can do for ourselves.  I hope you soon have positive answers and get some good rest.  I am happy for you!I hope you find some joy in your life, now that you're going to see a professional. I wish you all the best!"
"For the past four weeks, I've been having nightmares and hearing voices telling me of horrible things. They're not random voices, but rather, the voices of those I care about.","I would recommend that you talk with a mental health professional near you about the details so you can have some really specific support for what you are going through.I don't know if you can understand when the voices are saying, but I wonder how you feel about what you are hearing? If the voices are just at night, is it possible that they are part of a nightmare or a dream? If you recall your nightmares, consider writing them down so that you can remember their content and work with a mental health professional to look for patterns.One thing that may help you while you are awake is to try to stay connected to the room you're in. For example, take time to notice your feet on the floor, hips in the chair, and shoulders against the back of the chair. You can also try mindfulness techniques, such as noticing what is around you or changing your breathing patterns. These ideas may help in the meantime prior to having more specific ideas from someone near you.Thanks for reaching out!","I'm sorry to hear you have to deal with this for such a long time.I've had my share of nightmares and hearing voices, and that it has been 4 weeks with them.It sounds like the voices are telling you very important things, which is something that can be frightening!Since you said that the voices have been telling you horrible things, that is a little unnerving.You could be worried about if you are getting depressed and then not being able to find the right way to treat it.There are different methods and approaches to dealing with anxiety.Are the voices frightening to you?If you can tolerate the voices with some fear to it, then you do have a chance to get really good at managing your anxiety levels.You could be considering a combination of treatments, and that is good to know because there's so much that can be said.If you feel comfortable talking with a professional, you could see a psychiatrist or psychologist.They would be able to assess your symptoms and recommend a treatment plan.There are things that you can do by yourself too, that can help improve your mental health as well, such as: 1) Taking time to reflect on things that are going well for you and being grateful for it. 2) Trying to take care of yourself both physically and emotionally. 3) Talking to a trusted friend to have someone to vent to about your difficulties with anxiety and depression. 4) Practicing Mindfulness - This may seem obvious, but it's something that many people who struggle with anxiety benefit from.If you are not sure that you need more help with therapy at this time, then what that means in terms of what you will do is to ask yourself two questions: Are you willing to try to understand your voice? Do you know that you need more help?If you feel that you aren't willing to try to figure out what's going on in your mind at this time, it's better not to, because in the long run, it could be that you don't want your voice to continue to be telling you bad things.It's worth remembering that people also hear voices from time to time, and the most common are those of children or pets!Have you ever heard that the voices are telling you that you are going to die?I hope not because you have a strong memory to remind you of this. I hope that you get some peace of mind so you have time to learn how to deal with this. It"

My motivation has gone away. It's hard to get out of bed. I really don't know what to do anymore. I'm miserable. My anxiety and depression have taken over my life.,"Anxiety and Depression are challenging experiences to live with and to manage on a daily basis. I would say that both are challenges to overcome but solutions to living healthy and well exist. Step 1: Talk about it. With friends, family, partners, counselors, and other trusted people in your life. Step 2: Create a plan with a counselor to learn new skills that help you recognize and manage your symptoms. Step 3: Don't give up. Working on yourself can be difficult and hard at the beginning. Stick with it and you will be able to find exercises, tools, and resources that help you live well.","Your friend is asking you to consider an important topic in order to help your friend. That topic is anxiety. Because you are experiencing a number of symptoms like being miserable, having difficulty getting out of bed, and having depression, anxiety probably has a lot to do with it. The good news is that anxiety can be treated. Anxiety symptoms can be extremely persistent, in ways that prevent people from making steps and changing patterns of their lives. The first step to taking over your life is understanding what a person's anxiety is as well as recognizing what is impacting your day to day life. Your feelings are valid. It is a normal response when you feel overwhelmed by many emotions from life. You are doing a great job with describing your feelings because it seems like your emotional and mental state are all connected and intertwined. Often, anxiety can cause difficulty sleeping, appetite, and other body sensations. It can also result in you being overprotective of your belongings and/or in having trouble telling people what you feel. When it comes to physical symptoms, anxiety can often cause headaches, stomach aches, or other issues. For your friend, a helpful thing to take is to give her some space. If she has a supportive friend and family member, her therapist can help her feel safe enough to have that space. You are asking to see her and there are more people in her life who want to help. In the meanwhile, you can help by being your friend as a good friend would. This could involve running errands for her, or bringing food to her, or helping her with tasks like cooking or mowing the lawn. There is a lot of wisdom in being there to support your friend in this way."
What are the basic skills a good counselor needs to have?,"Here is a list of skills I use every session, and a short explanation of what they are:Reflecting: Paraphrasing what clients have said so that they know you understand themValidating: Helping clients to know that their point of view is valuable and rationalClient-centered talk: Maintaining focus on the client in therapy sessions, rather than a therapist talking about themselvesAttending: Nonverbal or verbal cues that indicate I am listening to a client (i.e., nodding, leaning in, affirmations)Reframing: Helping a client to see a problematic behavior or situation in a different way (usually only works well after they feel heard and understood)","Good counselor needs a broad set of skills and emotional and psychological competencies. Here are some of the key skills a good counselor needs, categorized by type:

**I. Core Counseling Skills:**

*   **Active Listening:** Not just hearing what the client says, but truly understanding what they're saying, both verbally and non-verbally. Asking reflective questions (e.g., 'Can you tell me more about that?') and summarizing the information to confirm that your understanding is correct.
*   **Empathy:** The ability to understand and share the feelings of another person. This is more than sympathy which is feeling pity or compassion for another person. It's understanding and 'walking in their shoes'. The ability to understand people's perspective as different from your own is key for both understanding their issues and helping them resolve them.
*   **Communication:** Clear and compassionate communication. You will be an ally, confidante and guide in this. Clients need to feel safe enough to share vulnerable information about themselves.
*   **Emotional regulation:** The ability to control and understand your own emotions, so you don't harm other peoples' feelings. Learning how to calm down when things get hot in your mind is a great first step for being a good counselor.

**II. Therapeutic Relationship Skills:**

*   **Establishing Rapport:** The best way to give people what they need is for them to feel comfortable and safe. Establishing trust is how it's done
*   **Motivational Interviewing:** A type of counseling that focuses on helping people identify their reasons to make different changes, and how to do it
*   **Reflection:** This is about helping the client understand themselves to be more self aware

**III. Understanding the Basics of Behavior Change**

*   **Motivational Interviewing:** Understanding how people change is huge. It is something that you can learn how to do that has a good chance of showing results.

This will give you a strong head start on being a counselor. I hope this helps!"
"I'm a teenager, and while I’ve never been to any kind of therapist, I noticed I experience several anxiety symptoms. I frequently find myself not going out and following my parent around the house. I can't go into stores (grocery stores specifically) on my own, and when I do, I have to be on the phone with my dad the whole time. I also forget things a lot.","With the way you described your anxiety, it sounds like you have different types of anxiety. I'm not sure whether you have anxiety of public places, large crowds, being alone  (sometimes called separation anxiety), or some combination thereof.One thing that would be helpful would be to track your anxiety and see how anxious you are (on a scale of 1 to 10) in different situations. Also, if you know what leads up to your anxiety, it would be good to know this as well so you can look for patterns.As for forgetting things, you could be anxious because you are forgetting things or you could be forgetting things because you are anxious. When you are having anxiety, certain parts of your brain are overactive because you are in a kind of protective mode. It's also possible that forgetting things and anxiety are not related.Something else to try would be to notice where you feel your anxiety in your body and put your hand there is a way of giving yourself comfort.Another thing about anxiety is that having anxiety can lead to more worry about having more anxiety. One thing that helps for some people is to go to the regular primary care doctor to make sure that there are no physical problems (just for the regular physical) so they know that there are no physical problems and that the anxiety will lessen in a few minutes.Also, if you are able to notice your feet on the floor or your hips in the chair, this is helping you to be mindful of your body and connecting you to your surroundings. During this in combination with naming your emotions can be soothing as well. For example, in the grocery store, if you are feeling anxious, you could say to yourself ""I'm anxious right now and I'm okay"" while gently shifting your weight from one foot to the other. No one around you would notice what you were doing and the motion may be soothing to you.Anxiety can have a lot of different causes and things that trigger it. If it is difficult for you to work it out on your own (which is very common), consider talking with a local therapist so you can have more specific ideas.Also consider making a list of people who you trust and what it is about them that makes you feel comfortable.","""How are you feeling about this?"""
It's really hard to not have negative feelings about friends who don't put any effort into nourishing our relationship.,"One thing I would ask is ""why are you still hanging with those {friends}?"" A relationship needs to be nurtured by both parties, it is a dynamic fluctuation between two people. I would ask you to question why you continue to remain together as friends, I always believed that a relationship should emit positivity towards all parties involved, if your in a relationship that is one-sided, it is inevitable that it will start to de-compensate. Never travel with the circus, never travel with fools, everything in life should have some positive payout, will things at times be negative, of course they will, but in order to keep something or someone in your life there should be more positivity than negativity.Hope this helps, C",I think friendship is a beautiful thing. It means that there are other people with whom you feel you have a good connection. I feel like there is some good in this. I will try to be more attentive to the people around me and spend more time and energy on good friends.
"This is preventing me from getting a job. I have bad relationship with my bipolar mother. I am living with her but it stresses me out so much to be around her that I have locked myself in my room. I have no friends or other family to help me. I have no money for therapy, but I think I need therapy before I can secure a job.",A good first step would be to make an appointment with your primary care provider & discuss your concerns.  They would have resources available to help in your particular situation.,"You're probably feeling a lot of different things right now. There are 2 different groups of things I'd tell you to consider, first what is causing a lot of stress in your life right now. My first thought would be bipolar disorder which, in fact, is what you are probably experiencing. I have had several friends who have come out with what seems similar to you, but they had a much better experience with bipolar disorder than I had, as well as knowing more about what to do with it. What I think is most interesting is my advice to you would be to focus on your treatment, therapy and what you want to do to help your mother. If what you are experiencing in the house is not something you'd like to live with, then this could be the solution to the problem.   You could talk to her about your concerns and ask her to be more respectful to you. You could be more direct about when you are available to discuss some potential solutions.   Talking to her is good for your mental health as well, so this is something you need to be willing to accept and be open to.   The two other important things I'd recommend are that you are careful not to let her be angry with you or in the house.   If this happens then you do not have to have a conversation with your mother at all, and you can't do your best in the long run. It would also be good to get out of your room, and just walk around for a while.   Once you have done this you will then find the person that you will spend more time with and maybe you can work your way toward a life with your mother."
"I am lazy. I am very aware of the problem and try to talk myself out of it all the time, but I never seem to shake the habits. I try to think of what it is doing to me and my future, but no matter what, I keep creating excuses for myself to continue the procrastination. All I'm ever left with is regrets and a low grade. I am at an all-time low in my life, and I'm not even that old. I've always been a straight-A student, but now I'm getting C's and F's, and it hurts me to know that I am way better than that. It's not even like the work is hard.","I am sorry to hear that you are going through such a tough time. It sounds to me like you are suffering from depression to some degree. Have you seen a therapist or talked to anyone about your problems? If not, I would advise that you do so sooner than later so that you can learn what is causing you to be unmotivated and causing difficulty with breaking the cycle that you are in. It is also a good idea to get a medical evaluation from your doctor to rule out any medical causes for your current condition. Most often, difficult situations that life throws at us, along with an inability to think positively, and break bad habits are what cause depression. Some things you can do immediately are seek help from a professional, schedule in time every day to engage in pleasurable (or once pleasurable) activities, exercise daily, and practice thinking more positively. Set a few daily goals for yourself and write them down each morning or the night before. Achieving your goals every day will give you a sense of accomplishment and can lead to feeling more optimistic and capable. Additionally, keep a journal to write down how you are feeling and what ideas you have to help feel better. Sometimes having these ideas written down make it more real and tangible. Know that depression is most often curable but takes work and a desire to change (which you clearly have). Once you start feeling better about yourself and your life, your grades should naturally begin to improve, as you will have more motivation and energy to focus on that particular area. Best of luck to you!","I understand that you want to understand why you are feeling these emotions, and hope you are able to break free of those bad habits. I will advise you to take a deep breath and sit quietly and think about it. I also recommend you try to understand the root of these habits. If you are able to get a professional mental health or counseling, you may find yourself with the ability to gain a better understanding of the factors that are affecting you."
"Recently my boyfriend broke up with me because of my bad language. But he thinks I'm a total b***h. I know I'm bipolar and can be selfish. He called me today and says he can't go through with the breakup. I was broken and didn't want a breakup to begin with, but I know I'm horrible at times and can't help it. It's like I'm battling myself. What do you feel?","Both options seem reasonable.  Seeking individual therapy will help you to cope with the mood changes that come with bipolar disorder, will give you a space to vent your negative thoughts, and will allow you to find the coping mechanism to address life and relational challenges.  IF your boyfriend is interested in attending couples therapy with you, it will assist in identifying the problems in the relationship that pushed him to the breakup and will give both of you the tools to communicate and resolve conflicts.I am a Licensed Professional Counselor in Texas, currently providing individual, couples, and family therapy services in West Houston.  You may reach me at 787-466-5478 to schedule an appointment.    ¿Debería buscar ayuda yo sola o junto con mi novio?Mi novio me dejo recientemente por ser mal hablada.  El piensa que soy una p***a.  Yo sé que soy bipolar y que puedo ser egoísta.  El me llamo hoy para decirme que no puede continuar separado.  Yo estaba destruida y no quería que nos dejáramos desde el inicio, pero se lo horrible que puedo ser a veces y que no lo puedo evitar.  Es como si estuviera en guerra conmigo misma.  ¿Qué piensas?Ambas opciones son razonables.   Buscar terapia individual te ayudara a manejar los cambios de estado de ánimo que son partes del desorden bipolar, también te dará espacio para ventilar los pensamientos negativos y encontrar herramientas para enfrentar problemas relacionales y de la vida diaria.   SI tu novio está interesado, también pueden asistir a terapia de pareja para poder identificar las razones de la separación, y obtener las herramientas apropiadas para  comunicarse apropiadamente y resolver conflictos.

You're right to see myself as being bad and for some reason can't stop it, what a pain. Here are some things to consider:

*   **Bipolar and Language:** It can be a tricky subject to cover with your boyfriend. A bad word is just a way of expressing yourself, that is usually more about being angry at someone/something than about you, and it sounds like your boyfriend is very worried about anger, which is understandable. It could also be related to some issues from childhood. If he is afraid of you being angry, which is a very common behavior for people with depression, and he doesn't know how to communicate what's going on with him and you, this may not be something that can be resolved quickly. If you have your own time, you could also ask him, ""What does a person with bipolar disorder think about anger?"" or ""What do you think about anger?"" Maybe you can start a conversation with him about his thinking and feelings. This may not be helpful to everyone, but here you get some indication of his viewpoint on something related to you, and could also be useful in finding the reasons why he is angry at you.  The good news is that a therapist that knows both depression and bipolar disorder can help you to start a conversation.  Your therapist can also help you to see how to best express yourself in a way that does not give your anger or hurt into your boyfriend. It's a really good idea to also talk to your own parents and a trusted adult to discuss the feelings you want to express."
"My girlfriend's grandma passed away 5 months ago. They were very close. She took care of her till she died. Things kinda returned to normal few weeks later. Last month it feels like we hit a brick wall. Intimacy fell off. I asked what's up. She says she can't connect with anyone and that it's not me. She used to be very open and expressive. Now she gives short answers and has no interest in sex or any touching. When we did have sex in the last month, something felt really off. Now I'm very insecure about us and have thoughts of her cheating. She says otherwise, but I don't know. It just feels like something is really off.","Grief has a huge impact on us and everyone's reaction is different. The one common reaction however is to shut down and distance ourselves. Her relationship with her grandmother was close, given she took care of her up until she passed. It sounds like she is working through a difficult loss and her ability to connect with you, or anyone else, is likely low right now. Trust what she is telling you and try to be there for her as she works through it. If she finds it too difficult to connect again, a good grief counselor can help her get back on track.","The most likely thing in the past few weeks, besides her health and the loss of her grandma, was intimacy loss for the same reason it was for him and not for you. 5 months is a long time, but intimacy is not really that hard to fix. Also, remember that your girlfriend has been feeling sad and lonely. It doesn't mean she is cheating, or that you're not special. Sometimes we just need some time to feel better and with this, 5 months is a realistic amount of time to fix it. Your questions are asking a lot of your girlfriend, and not very reasonable. For example, questioning her feelings about her intimacy with you, and whether she is cheating is only a part of that mystery. You will never know unless you talk about it with her and let her be honest with you.  (and make sure you know how long it will take before you can tell her that you're seeing some of the same things as her, and what her level of depression is.) I have never seen someone be very open with his feelings in therapy. If you're a man, and it feels that way to you,  then I would suggest that you try to talk to her first (or see if you can work out a way to talk to her). I don't think you need a therapist in this case.I hope you get some answers and understand where you're coming from now."
"My son stole my debit card and lied about it. It's not the first time he has lied. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know if I should punish him or make him do something. I've tried talking to him and asking if anything was wrong. I have grounded him, but nothing works. What should I do?","Hi Enid, You sound like a sensitive parent; I like that you talked to your son to see if anything is wrong. There is some key information here (I don't know your son's age, whether he spent any money, whether he put the card back, or how many times he's stolen), and my answer might be different depending on those details, but I'll give you my thoughts.I see it as every child's job to figure out the rules and find where their power is in the world. In order to accomplish that, many of them test limits. ""What can I get away with?"" is a question they have to find the answer to. If a child knows the rules, they're much more likely to not test limits (because they already know the limits). So, part of testing limits is experimenting with stealing and lying. Not all kids steal, but I would say pretty much every child lies at some point. It's a normal behaviour, and most of the time it's about small things that don't matter and we don't even find out. Stealing a debit card is a bit more serious, and I'm not surprised he lied about it. If you absolutely know that he took it, it's okay to tell him that you believe he did this thing and also lied about it. It's appropriate to give a consequence for this type of behaviour, so that the child doesn't do it again. The consequence should be as natural and logical as possible. The behaviour (stealing) was harmful to you, so doing you a favour with extra chores might be a good idea. It's funny, because as parents we try to tell our kids that lying is bad, but they know they'll get a consequence if they tell the truth so there are natural deterrents to being honest (we don't want people to know our mistakes). It's a dilemma. If you really want to focus on the lying part, you can tell him that you won't give him a consequence for the lying if he decides to come clean with the truth within one day. That gives him incentive to come to you with truth. It sometimes works with kids to give them a chance to come clean and then reward them for telling the truth. You can set your child up for success and train them to tolerate honesty. Put a cookie on the counter. Tell your child to take the cookie at some point in the day. Then ask them later if they took the cookie. You're making honesty fun. Kids love games. Basically, there's as much power in rewarding the positive behaviour as punishing the negative. If this is the first serious offence for your son, don't make a big deal of it; consequence him and see if he learns. If it's a pattern, that's different and you may want the input of a therapist.","I read your husband's letters, and I am able to offer some insights that may be helpful for you in helping your son. It appears there's a pattern of lying and you've tried talking to him. It sounds like you're likely at one with your son, and that he may be resistant to confronting his actions.  This could be caused by feelings of shame, insecurity, and a desire to avoid accountability. Regardless, I would suggest that you seek a professional from your local mental health center to help you with this.  They may help you find some help for your son as well."
"I am a teenage girl. I've been seeing the same dream once in a while since I was very young. The problem is that I don't remember anything about this dream. I still know that it's the same one, and then I wake up in a panic, and I cry really loud without knowing the reason. Why do I see the same dream, why can I not remember it, and what should I do to remember it?","There is no scientifically established formula for understanding dreams, that I know about, however, many people get a great deal of value from exploring what their dreams mean. It is believed by many that our dreams contain metaphors that represent meaningful patterns in our lives and relationships and if we pay attention to them we can learn important things about ourselves. One thing you might try, to see if you can get more insight into the dream and possibly begin remembering things, is to take note of whatever you do remember, any details about your experience, such as when do you wake up from the dream, how do you feel, both emotionally and physically, what are you thinking about when you wake up, is there any pattern in terms of what happens to you in your waking life around the time you have this dream... If you can keep a journal or a recording device to speak into by your bed, you can try to record whatever you do remember and notice as soon as you wake up. People seem to have more difficulty remembering dreams, the more time they let go by before attempting to record the dream, or if you go back to sleep before recording what you remember.","I will do my best to help you find an answer, but I'm not as adept at solving some of your questions as you may be. It would be a good idea to go through the questions in detail, and then you can tell me your answer about why the answer is the same.  I also don't know much about what happens when you sleep and dream; it is just that dreams are made up of what we think about while we're awake. Our memories are built from experiences that have already happened to us in order to help us go forward in life. You have a really strong connection to this dream; perhaps this is something you have in common with some other people.  Have you found any other similar dreams at times?"
I've recently thought that i could be transgender but I've never had the mind of a girl.,"Hello Frostproof,Thinking about becoming transgender and being transgender are slightly different.  This is a topic that is best discussed with a therapist that specializes in LGBTQ issues.  From what you have written it sounds as if you still have some confusion as to where you fit in with the ""labeling system"".  While labels provide a means to quickly identify and classify, they can also feel restrictive or confining.  Instead of focusing on fitting into a specific classification, explore who you are as a person and celebrate your positive qualities and those things that make you uniquely you!  There are many options for you to find a therapist and e-therapy is also an option.  You can try Breakthrough an online service.   Here is some reading for refection that you may find helpful.  Yin Yang Woman Man http://dld.bz/ejVK2  What does it mean to be a woman or a man?","I don't know about this yet. I have a feeling that this is for the best.I am not in a very good place right now.I have been in therapy for my entire life, and the last few years have been a bit of a rollercoaster.I thought that maybe if I was transgender, I would be in a great place.The idea that I would not be an attractive person would have made me feel more in control of my life.But that is far from the truth.I may be a transgender person, but I need to figure out my gender identity before I can feel comfortable as a trans person.I have not yet taken this step.Let me be real, I am scared."
"Because we are on opposite coasts, we try to talk early mornings, but she is constantly interrupted by visitors. I suggested setting aside some time, but she has made it very clear she has no intention of changing her lifestyle. She is also drinking beer every day on antipsychotics.","The answer depends on how satisfied and happy you feel in being part of this friendship.From what you write, there aren't any statements as to what gives you happiness about being a friend to this person.Since you already made a request of. your friend and she isn't following through, you could ask if she is willing to work with your suggested plan.The friendship may take a new format, depending on your friend's response.Its possible to be in contact more spontaneously, when either of you feel like contacting the other.What matters most is your own dissatisfaction with the current relationship status.Even if you change to a, birthday and holiday only conversation, or some other style of interacting, at least it will be the result of the effort from each person, not just one, who is you, designing arrangements which only you are willing to keep.","I have my wife (I'm one of the partners) who has a very different personal style than you.  I've found that by letting her know that I will try to be more supportive when it comes to the drinks that she is consuming (alcohol, beer) the more she is willing to work with me on being better about it, the more likely she is to work with me on trying to change her habits. As for setting aside time, you know that I want to be an active listener to my wife, but in order to be an active listener, I need to understand what she's feeling.I think that we would try to find some time for both of us, perhaps after dinner, on a couple of nights a week, so we both can sit down and really talk about what we are both hoping to come out of that situation."
I suffer from checking and cleaning OCD. Can counseling help me to get over it?,"Counseling can be very effective for OCD. In particularly, a kind of therapy called Exposure Response (Ritual) Prevention Therapy is considered the 'gold standard' for the treatment of OCD. What this is, is a specific protocol that helps you build relaxation strategies and to increase the amount of time between your checking/cleaning rituals while also helping you to face any of the fears that OCD given you until those rituals and fears are no longer interfering with your life. Research has shown that this kind of therapy may even be more effective for OCD than medication, https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.162.1.151","Is there something you're hoping to accomplish by the end of this session? For example, are you hoping for more freedom from those compulsive behaviors? Are you hoping for a more accurate way to see how you’re working at the core of these thoughts and actions? Do you want to be able to set certain goals to help you learn more about yourself? If I was getting your question right now, I'd say: We'll explore how they started... How you're feeling about what you're trying to accomplish... We'll explore how you're feeling to achieve your goals... How your goals might help you break free from the cycle of checking and cleaning... For now, the goal is to make sure you feel supported on your journey to becoming more free and calm.  I am here for you, and I hope you will enjoy your counseling session! If we are in a session, don't hesitate to reach out to your counselor to learn more about your goals, and ask your counselor to help in a way that works for you.    We will work as a team and we both know that we will have the best chance of success if we stay connected and learn from each other.   How are you feeling today? And what is one small thing you're doing today to promote calm and well-being? Feel free to tell me!"
"My brother has been a heroin addict for years, and he’s now in his mid-30s. He has taken from me my mom and my grandparents. He's sick in the head. Now he moved his girlfriend into the house because they both manipulated us. Today, my mom and my brother went toe-to-toe over his girlfriend not helping around the house and always being high. I ended up hitting my brother for getting so close to my mom's face. I feel terrible, but he's always picking his girlfriend over us. Mind you, he tells other girls that he hates his girlfriend, he's single, and she's only living here because he feels bad. We tried kicking them out and everything, but nothing is working. They do nothing to try and help.",I think the best thing for you is to speak with someone on how you can best cope with the situation.  It can be challenging living in a household with someone who is currently addicted.  It is also important that you realize that you can only work on yourself.  Other individuals need to take the same accountability.  Enabling often happens in households with addiction. It can be a challenging environment to live in.,"Hi! First of all, I am sorry for what happened with your mom. There is no better time as all family members need to talk about their problems and decide what to do together. When we are in a family, it's easy to put our issues aside and to try to work in silence. Maybe we are all wrong. I think there is one thing to know about family dynamics and why they are the way they are. When we are young, we often need to control the other people in our lives. When we are older, we learn that we can no longer control the people in our lives. And it seems like this is what is happening between you and your brother's girlfriend. When we are young, we need to be very protective of our family and to take care of them. But when we are older, we are not so protective of our family. And then this can change a family when people aren't able to help each other. In your case, since you were young, it sounds like that this is what happened. As we grow up, we've learned to let go of our family and to let others take care of us. But as our family becomes older, we get better at taking care of our families. And with your brother's girlfriend and your family, you've learned more that we will need to get better at taking care of our families, at a younger age than we were. So I think when you start to learn how to take care of your family, you have just done a very good thing. You are finally able to take care of your family by being a good family member. I have learned from you that you have been a good family member and it is really nice to know that. You are able to take care of your family by yourself. Your mom can't do any better. So you do a very good job and are a very good and loving person. And I love you, I love your mom and I love your brother. I am your family now and I love him and I love his girlfriend. Your mom and you are able to get your family to help each other. I know the feelings of frustration that you have. It doesn't mean that it is wrong to feel that way, and I know how good it feels to have good relationships. As the people that take care of the people you love, you've done a good thing. You have always had a good family member. You've been a good"
I keep on begging him to come back. I am so unhappy with him but am so scared of being a single parent to our son. I was abused as a little girl and that has made to be very abusive to men. What should I do...,"Major change frightens almost everybody.Don't be so afraid of your fear that you let yourself beg and are willing to accept unhappiness as a standard in your marriage.If you start considering that life can be better than what is current for you now, new possibilities and ideas will start developing in your mind.Consider finding a therapist so that you have private space to talk in detail about your fears and the new ways of seeing your Self.A therapy relationship, since it is safe and supportive, will be a good balance to having been abused, suffered, and unhappy.","I understand that your son and you, have both had difficult experiences in your lives that have impacted your self-respect. If the one you seek support from in this situation is in a different level of self-respect than you have in your life, that can affect you greatly. When seeking a relationship where you are confident you can stand being vulnerable, that relationship will likely feel more complete and fulfilling than any relationship where your self-respect is lower.  Do you feel happy and secure with yourself?  Or do you feel as though you don't want to be in a relationship?   I want to point out that even if you are not feeling happy and/or secure in yourself, what is important is that you are willing to open your heart and try for a relationship with someone else!    I think you should start with reaching out to a therapist to talk through your feeling's in more depth and develop strategies for what you need to do to feel more secure in yourself and in relationships."
"I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for a number of years. I have been on medication, but lately my depression has felt worse. Can counseling help?","Thank you for asking this important question. I find that there are three steps to getting ready for treatment. Step one is expressing interest in wanting to receiving treatment for the outcome of positive behavioral change. Congratulations you did the first step! You are showing your readiness to start counseling by asking this question. Now the second step is to find a counselor who specializes in treating clients with Anxiety and Depression. The therapeutic orientations I have found to be helpful in treating clients with  Anxiety and Depression are a combination of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with Mindfulness, and Solution Focused Brief Therapy. Receiving meditation for your symptoms if part of the treatment, and the other part is receiving counseling to increase your resilience for future events. Research has found that medication and psychotherapy treatments together shows the most effective outcome for Depression.  The third step is to increase your positive self-talk to motivate yourself to attend treatment. As counselors, we are aware of the anxieties and fears that are associated with talking to a new professional for the first time. However, remind yourself that you are doing this to improve your well being. I hope this was helpful, and good luck with your treatment journey.","It does look like a good time to be talking to someone about this. So what do you think the effects are of depression and anxiety, and how can it help?"
I love my girlfriend so much. I get an erection even just thinking about her or seeing her. But the two times we tried to have sex I couldn't get an erection. We've only had sex once and it was a long time ago.    Why this is happening and what can I do about it?,"I want to be short and brief about this. First, If you can achieve a good erection at anytime without your girlfriend, your penis is fine. However, erections work through getting enough blood flow to the penis. If you are having any sort of mental related concern (anxiety, depression, stress, etc) it can cause your blood vessels to constrict and keep your penis from becoming erect. After reading your concerns, my questions would be: What are you thinking about right before and during sex?"" ""Do you feel anxious or nervous during that time?"" Have you ever experienced not getting an erection before?"" I am assuming it has do to with what you are thinking and their is a certain amount of anxiety you are having during or right before sex. If you want to work this out, I would encourage you to work on your thought process and learn to relax your mind and your body (meditation/relaxation exercises). Focus more on enjoying the experience through your 5 senses. What do you smell, take it in and enjoy it. What do you hear, take it in and enjoy it. What do you see, take it in and enjoy it. What do you feel, take it in and enjoy it. Calm yourself! Not having an erection is not the end of the world and happens all the time to men. If you freak out about it, it will happen more. Just relax, believe it is normal and try again and ENJOY the beauty in front of you!","Dear Client, What is the purpose of the process you have been engaged in? I would love to hear what you think you need and your goals. The first step is for you to define your goals. Then we will begin the next phase of exploration What are you seeking when you experience this erection? It is possible that there are many things contributing to this and many are unrelated to sexual desire I have some ideas that will help you to explore yourself and your needs, along with understanding the process you have engaged in. I strongly encourage you to seek a therapist or counselor to help you explore your feelings and thoughts. We need to help you understand how to create a sexual life that feels good to you, both emotionally and physically.  If you feel like the desire is a reflection of feelings around your relationship, then we can start by exploring them together. A therapist is a valuable resource that will help you grow and understand yourself better.  It would be wonderful to help you find the right path for sexual fulfillment."
Then turn right back around and say he loves me and needs me. This rollercoaster is crazy.,"Yes, I agree with your view about the ""rollercoaster"" sounding ""crazy""!Concentrate on knowing what your reasons are for staying with this guy, given the broad facts that you state.What are you gaining from being together and are these gains outweighing how you feel when your companion says the opposite of what he just told you?Also, examine yourself for any fears of being alone.Very often, people stay in detrimental relationships because of a fear that being alone will feel worse.It may, initially feel this way after a breakup.This is from change itself.Eventually, stability and peace of mind return, and being alone with oneself is preferred to being taken on an emotional rollercoaster by a partner.","Hello, my friend, I love you a great deal, but I can't see your life as I have to listen to the details of your life. I love you because I was a child here too, so I know how it feels to be lost. Please tell me what you are going through or you will be lost for a while.  I love you."
"A few years ago I was making love to my wife when for no known reason I lost my erection,    Now I'm In my early 30s and my problem has become more and more frequent. This is causing major problems for my ego and it's diminishing my self esteem. This has resulted in ongoing depression and tearing apart my marriage.    I am devastated and cannot find a cause for these issues. I am very attracted to my wife and want to express it in the bedroom like I used to.    What could be causing this, and what can I do about it?","If you haven't already, please see a doctor.  ED can be caused by any number of physical conditions and you need to get checked out.  Once you have ruled out any physical issues that interfere with getting an  erection, it's time to look for more subtle causes.  Unfortunately, you may have gotten yourself into a mind set of ""I hope I can, but what if I can't?""  which is certain to interfere with performance.Again, rule out physical causes (can you tell I think that's important?), then talk with your wife about working  together to find the right approach.  It might be a good idea, for example, to take the pressure off by enjoying each other without intercourse.  You can have great sex without penetration and you can have physical intimacy without sex, so slow down and experiment.  You might find more pleasure than you expect when you can relax knowing there doesn't have to be a ""finish line"".Again, yes the  third time, SEE A DOCTOR, just in case there's something going  on.  Once you get the all clear, find joy and spontaneity with your wife again by being creative and pressure free.","Your question is asking about a common issue that women experience when men are intimate with them. It has to do with the pleasure responses for women. Men tend to reach a certain level of physical excitement that is for them satisfying and rewarding, and it could be possible that your partner has reached this level. If so, it may be possible that he's not giving the same level of attention to you. Also, it is possible he's not taking the time to look at you to satisfy you. Your wife may have some sort of physical issue that has to do with sex, or your wife may just be tired and not focused on you right now. A change in hormones will also happen as women get more mature, but this can also happen for men too. If he is really trying to help, and the problem will stop without your husband being aware of how the problem is happening, then it's important to talk to him, but the first step is your husband not being aware of it. Ask the questions listed that I have included above to help you assess. What is your wife's physical issues? Is she not giving you the same attention? Does she find himself less interested in sex? Is she distracted by something else while you're intimate? If these questions are answered yes, then talking to your husband about these issues may help to solve the problems you're experiencing. If your wife is not being attuned to you and you and he're able to find the time to give you his full attention, or to change his habits around sex, then it may be time for them to look at their own sexual interactions. What would help your wife to feel more in tune with you, as well? Ask her what it would take for her to give you more attention and attention? A couple's therapist can help you discover the other factors that may be at play and to help you see what your spouse would like to see from you.   If you are experiencing sexual issues with your wife or your husband, it may be helpful to consider seeing a therapist.   A therapist will be able to help you and you and your husband learn to communicate better with each other about how you want to do sex.    You can also start by thinking about what your spouse has tried to improve your sex life."
"I find that I imagine things sexually, and I hate it because it puts strain on my relationship. I feel helpless and guilty. I want it to go away, and I want to make my woman happy again.","It is completely understandable that you would like to find a way to make these intrusive thoughts go away, however, your feeling that you can't control having these thoughts is accurate. It's also understandable that you would feel helpless and guilty, given that you see how these thoughts are effecting your relationship, though I would encourage you to go easy on yourself and remember that you aren't choosing to have these thoughts. I'm sure that if there was a switch to turn them off, you would flip it.There is no magic technique or pill that can guarantee these thoughts will go away, however, therapy may still have a lot to offer. In working with a competent therapist, you may be able to gain insight into where these thoughts are coming from and develop new ways of relating to them so that they do not leave you feeling as helpless and guilty and can be more present with your partner. Though there is no guarantee that the thoughts will go away, this may also be a result of work with a therapist. Either way, you may be able to find a way to deal with the thoughts and show up in your relationship in a way that will be satisfying to you and your partner.","It sounds like you're in an unfortunate place with your relationship. As a woman in the relationship in question, what do you know about how your partner is feeling? The question ""Why do you find the sexual feelings uncomfortable?"" that you asked the other woman in the relationship, that's really a great question to ask her. Hopefully it's going to open a dialogue for both of you. But as the person in the relationship, what you're telling yourself to the worst about the feeling that you're finding unwanted and uncomfortable as a result of this feeling and your history is very negative. It seems like you've been hurt in the past, and that has formed a pattern that may be very difficult to change. You've learned and been able to cope with such problems in the past, but that's a very limited area to deal with it in the present. Maybe this is worth trying out? A really good way to try it is to talk and really listen to your woman's ideas and perspective. You both need to feel to be in an equal power dynamic when there is a debate on what your girlfriend and partner think and feel about something."
"He is always telling me our fights are only and all my fault, he bashes me to our young child, and he is addicted to a few substances.","The behaviors you describe are boundary violations.  You can not change your spouse, but you can respond to his behaviors in ways that protect your boundaries and ensure your safety.  This is very hard to do without support.  Finding a therapist who understands the dynamics of abusive relationships may be helpful.  If you are not ready to do this, I recommend the book ""Boundaries"" by Dr. Henry Cloud and Dr. John Townsend.  It's a great resource for helping one recognize boundary violations and learning how to respond to them in ways that are constructive!","Hi you. I can hear you're in a state of conflict and he is abusive with you. In your current state you are being abused by your husband, and you may feel shame and fear that will affect the peace that you wish you had with him. There is so much you may not know about the abuse that you are being exposed to. An abusive person is not always violent, and he may be using other methods of manipulation.  Sometimes, being trapped, a victim of abuse would be the ""calming"" behavior. By being a victim of abuse the only way you may be able to resolve the issues would be through the process of abuse.  Being aware of the type of abuse that he is doing to you would give you a sense of safety and help you see what kind of behaviour is occurring.  You can start the process of addressing the problem by talking with a therapist and asking them if the situation is appropriate for you. If he is not and a therapist is available, you can begin talking to him about the fact that you are being abused, and to work out a plan on how you will do so. Talking with a therapist can also help you learn how to build up your confidence if you choose to end the relationship.It is okay to talk about him, he might just say he doesnt care.  But being able to be open with him, while also being closed off and protecting yourself from danger is very important."
"She was raised by her abusive father and his wife. 30 years ago I shot and killed my rapist and was convicted in Louisiana. I lost custody of my daughter and served 5 years. When I was released, she was 5 and didn't remember me. Many many sad memories came from my having to leave her visit after visit, having to leave her in Texas to travel back to Louisiana. She doesn't remember that. I do. Over the years, I thought we had developed a close mother daughter relationship. She gave me good reason to doubt that on several occasions but especially last year. I have been cruel to her verbally and to my son who I met years after giving him up for adoption. Last night, I was angry at the world and afraid of God. I drank and cussed out a maintenance worker for not doing his job 4 months running. Now I'm not only feeling guilty for that but afraid of being evicted now. Help.","Was either parent abusive or violent toward you?You sound to have suffered emotionally in your relationships since early in life.One point to consider is to strive for moderation in what you offer in relationships.A lot of what you've lived through is extreme, either as victim or perpetrator.If you imagine that apologizing to the custodian for the way spoke to him, would calm him down, do so.At the very least, you'll be actively resolving your guilt over cussing at him, and fear of his retaliation.","Hi!I understand you know how to deal with a lot of pain and anger.  I know that you could probably tell and do things to help yourself to deal with the anger and pain you are experiencing right now. You need to do a lot more to start with and it takes time to build yourself back up after something like that.I would say take the time to calm down in a room in the moment before you start talking with anyone else, as I was able to when I was in 8th grade.If your son and I can move forward in a positive way I would say we all want to have good parents and I'd be happy if we did.It is important to give people time to think before you think about calling them or speaking to them. The best way to handle what you know about your daughter is not to call her. If you wish to keep in contact it should not be your first contact.If you do call her it is not going to work as it does in general because the problem is that a relationship is lost and she will be very confused about why you aren't speaking with her, in which case if you do make a good effort it will be very difficult for her to work out how to proceed and if you don't make a good effort this means your actions are in fact a sign that the relationship with your daughter is ended. It may or may not be as simple as you think it is. You should be careful of what you wish for in order to get your child what is in her best interest."
"Her father and I have been dealing with this problem for quite some time now. She is an adolescent, and the problem is mostly food. She is now overweight, and we just don't know what to do anymore. She can be disrespectful and doesn't listen to or respect what we say.","I would be curious about there potentially being some emotional or physical trauma in your daughter's history that she is struggling with. Physical trauma is usually easier to identify, but emotional trauma can be feeling a lack of emotional connection in her important relationships, having experienced bullying, or some other emotional injury. The fact that there are some defiance symptoms going on suggests that she might be in need of a safe place to process what she's going through, and the potential issue with control or meeting emotional needs with food is also concerning. I would recommend looking for a therapist/counselor who works with children/adolescents in the area of addressing trauma for an assessment. They may be able to ask the right questions to see whether trauma is truly the issue.","Well, this is a bit of a unique situation. I'd be curious to learn about what kind of food she's eating and when she's eating those foods, as well as how much she is eating. I'd also like to know what types of feelings or situations are causing her to eat so much food that she feels is causing her some problems."
"My boyfriend of five years told me he cheated on me during our relationship after we broke up. We've since gotten back together and are trying to make it work. I don't know how to trust him now, but I really want to make it work, and it seems like he does too. But my trust issues are getting in the way and causing problems.","Hi Michigan,This is a common issue. How do you trust after you know someone is capable of hurting you? I totally get that it's hard, and I believe it's worth it if you truly love and want to be with someone. You can be stronger in the scarred places. I would suggest that you each have a separate job to do to rebuild this trust. It is definitely possible to rebuild it, because anything is possible if both people want it enough.Your boyfriend came clean to you...this is pretty crucial. He chose to honour your needs rather than keep the secret. You can use that as evidence in your ""proof that he loves me"" file. Work on that file...thicken it up. Having a thick ""he does care about me and wouldn't hurt me again"" file will help you. Other things that he can do to help you thicken that file (because after all, his behaviours caused this problem): answer all your questions, don't brush you off if you're feeling insecure, treat you as though you're a priority, avoid questionable contact with other women, have open communication, give you passwords to devices so there is transparency. He can help you to understand where those behaviours came from...why he cheated in the first places (although people aren't always good with those 'why' questions!)You can focus on telling yourself that people change, that he deserves a chance to show you he can be loyal (or at least you've decided to give him that chance), and that you want to be a trusting person. If you act like a trusting person, you will likely feel more like one. Don't go snooping, don't interrogate him. It's normal you might feel scared and try to tell him that when you do. Let him know what happens that leads to you feeling scared.This is a start for you. A good therapist can be helpful too!","You can trust your boyfriend because you've seen him cheat, and that is more than enough evidence to begin the process of trusting him again.  The fact that the other person you've been with is out is not the whole story, and he may have some issues at work, with friends, or in other relationships, which will certainly cause problems in your relationship, but if your boyfriend is truly remorseful for the other person you’ve been with, he will want to take action to stop this, but does that mean he will do what he needs to do to fix his relationship and show you he is committed to working on his work, as well as the relationship and his own issues?  If your boyfriend is truly invested in your relationship, you know that the problems with your own issues is most likely to be the root of the problems, but you are able to see how his problems are creating a problem with your situation, and so you feel comfortable offering him support."
I'm 17 and I'm sick and tired of going back and forth. I'd like to stay at my mother's house. This problem has really affected me. I've had anxiety attacks and suicidal thoughts and self-harm in the past.    Currently I'm going through anxiety and my thearapist is not available. How do I handle this?,"I am so sorry to hear you are going through this. Divorce can be so disruptive in a child's life.I'd really need a lot more information about your situation before I'd feel comfortable offering any advice or suggestions. There are so many variables, and not knowing the whole story, any advice could possibly make your situation worse.I do see some positives, though. One, you say you have a therapist. That's great! I hope you're able to talk to them about this soon. Still, they can't give you legal advice, and a lot of this situation may be dictated by the law. What your therapist can help with, though, is dealing with whatever situation you have to follow by law. If you can't change the situation, you at least need to learn how to cope with it better. Two, you're 17. When you're 18, you're legally an adult and will not be bound by any custody rules or visitation plans in place. Honestly, teenagers usually have a lot of say with the courts in custody arrangements. Since you didn't specify more on the situation, I have no idea what your specific situation is. Were your parents ever married? Are they separated or divorced? Was there ever a court hearing for custody? Not all couples have an official court order arrangement. All families are different, too. Was there abuse between your parents? Towards you by one of them? Does either of them have addiction issues, major health or mental health issues, or anything like that? You mentioned that you want to live with your mom, but didn't say why. Are you afraid to tell your dad you want to stay with your mom? Is mom the lenient and fun parent while dad is the more strict one, or is there something else going on? This isn't a decision that should be placed entirely on you, and it also isn't a decision that anyone else needs to make on your behalf without your input. But advice on what to do needs to come from the people who know more about your situation so they can help recommend the best thing for you. Whatever you do, hang in there! 18 will be here before you know it. Focus on that. Freedom. College. Plan for your future that YOU control, and focus on making it the best it can be. Do not let the anxiety and depression cloud your thoughts and make you do something irreversible.","First and foremost, do not be afraid to turn to a new therapist. Your therapist is not needed or appropriate for this. Your therapist may not be available and you cannot always go to them when you need them. Also, depression, anxiety, suicide, self-harm, and trauma have complicated and sometimes unpredictable effects on people in your age group. You may have a great deal of control over your behavior as you are now, but you are currently not in control. You are in a state of distress that your therapist may not be able to treat well as you are now. First, you need to see a new therapist."
"A few nights ago I talked to this girl I know about my self esteem issues for the first time. We talked for hours and she told me time and again that I was a great guy. She told me I was attractive, and have a great personality, etc. I really started to feel better about myself by the time I woke up the next morning. Now, though, I can't stop thinking about her, but I leave to go back to college in a few days and I go to school 4 hours away from her. So now I feel constantly depressed because even if I told her how I felt it wouldn't matter. I feel helpless and I don't know what to do.","Hey!  It takes a lot of courage to share your feelings with someone!  And it sounds like you have been lucky to meet someone who makes you feel safe enough to explore some of your more painful feelings.  A big part of the process, however, of strengthening your self-concept is learning how to tell yourself those positive messages that you heard from your friend!  Leaving for college may also be contributing to your feelings of unsteadiness.  Try this - Make a list of all of the positive things that you know are true about yourself.  Ask your friends and family to contribute to the list.  Then carry it with you in your wallet - and when you need a self-esteem boost, take a look at it!  You are in a season of life that presents lots of challenges and opportunities.  Reach out to your long-distance friend when you need support - and take a walk over to the campus counseling center and check out what they might have to offer.  Be Wise!","The way you feel when talking to your girl you know is a common experience, so maybe it can relate to why you feel helpless. Sometimes, it is useful to talk to someone you know and trust about how you are feeling, however, the issue here is that there is a potential for misinterpretation of the words you are using between you and your girlfriend. With the information that you’ve provided, if your girlfriend was aware of your feeling, then there is a very real possibility of false assumptions by her about how you feel.  Her assumption is that because I feel helpless, it means I don't care about her, this is not true.  If she was aware of your feelings, she would care about you and recognize that you are in need of her help to feel better. However, there is a possibility that your emotions would be misconstrued, causing this in the first place.  If I were to say to you, ""I want that you will change when I go back to school. I want to feel at least that the school makes me feel better than what I feel about myself when I am alone."" That is the problem here.  She's not expecting that I would call her out on a problem, but in exchange, she would just be happy that I'm going back to school to continue living my own life so that I don't feel stuck.  The problem is my inability to express these needs directly.  By saying ""I want that you will change when I go back to school. I want to feel at least the same way when I am alone.""  My girlfriend is very interested in my self esteem, and I'm sure in this instance she will think that I would appreciate her assistance with the problem as her own personal desire.  However, I feel helpless and as such cannot communicate my feelings.  That is a real problem and a very common one."
"I suffer from adult ADHD, anxiety disorder, and depression. It has been difficult to find a doctor in my area and my primary physician won't help. I am unemployed and overwhelmed. What would you suggest I do?","I would check out agencies that offer affordable counseling based on your income or very low cost counseling sessions, i.e., Pacific Clinics, Hathaway Sycamore, Pasadena Mental Health Center, Burbank Family Center. If you google affordable or low cost therapy in your particular area you will find resources to help you.","Please know that ADHD, anxiety, depression, unemployment and being unable to find a doctor are all a part of what you are experiencing right now. The good news that you know these are all struggles and can be worked on and it is not that these conditions are ""all bad"" but are not ideal and you do not need to feel they are ""bad"" . ADHD and Anxiety can be very helpful in finding and sustaining employment if you can find the right resources and work to fit you. But depression is a very difficult condition as it is one of the most challenging to find support for as people often don't get the right care to help them work through depression.  It is possible that you could find help with your depression and anxiety if a therapist could help you connect with them. If you are working in an office setting I would suggest that you find a job that is helping with your ADHD and anxiety and would do well and that fits your work style."
"My boyfriend lost his dad to suicide. He says that because his dad died, so did his heart. He says that he can't be there for me or love me anymore and wants nothing to do with me ever again. Why is he doing this when we were very happy together? He says that I have done nothing wrong but he just can't be with me.","I am sorry to learn of this.  You must be extremely frustrated and heartbroken.  To begin, he is correct.  You have done nothing wrong.  This is entirely a coping mechanism in overdrive.  It is fear.  It is anger.  It is extreme sadness.  It is feelings of abandonment.  It is intense emotional pain.  It is his way of protecting himself from potential unexpected additional loss.I am not familiar with how old this post is, but often, it will require time and understanding.  If he speaks with you, encourage him to get grief counseling.  Do not encourage it for your relationship, encourage it for his betterment coping with losing his dad.  Start there.  Good Luck.","Hi Alex,  You're asking a lot of yourself, and your boyfriend seems to believe that he's doing the right thing to protect you by cutting off all ties with you.  You have to know what is wrong when you are asked to go somewhere you don't want to go.  However, there is always the possibility that your boyfriend is being manipulated by someone else and that his reasons for doing this are not about you or what has happened in your life.  When you have a boyfriend who is unable to communicate with you, and tells you that he is the only one who cares about you, then you have a very hard time trusting him.  Your love for your boyfriend, love and desire to be with him, still exists, and being able to see that to be true is still an important part of healing.  You may also want to talk about what you can do to communicate better with him and to show him that you care.  I don't know if it's possible for you to have a positive relationship with him.  But maybe you can find a way to meet him and connect with him, in a safe environment with his girlfriend, until he is ready to know he can no longer take a chance on a relationship with you.  There's no shame in separating to heal, and as soon as possible, and starting with a place where you both can be safe and hear each other.  In general, if you are trying to get a divorce, if you see him get himself put in a position where he can't be there to be with you, then it's important to see if that is something that is not in his best interest.  If not, you would have a better idea of how to handle your time together in order to maintain a peaceful relationship."
I haven't uttered one word to my boyfriend in days. Now I'm over it and don't know how to approach the situation?,"In any relationship, it is important to be able to say ""I'm sorry"" because it shows vulnerability and openness. I recommend that you sit and have a discussion with him now that you are calm about why you were upset and how you would like to handle such incidents in the future. If you find yourself becoming upset again, I encourage you to take a 20 minute break and then come back to the conversation once you are no longer heated. Studies show that talking or discussing arguments are more effective once you have cooled down and you are more likely to hear/understand what your partner is trying to convey.","I would make a cup of tea, read a book, or watch a movie and write a few words to him, to talk to him about how you are feeling. Try to talk about what's happening between the two of you, or how you can communicate better in the future."
"My boyfriend and I have not had sex in a couple of weeks. He had to have a cyst removed on his testicles. I have been wanting to have sex with him for a while now, and it drives me crazy not to be able to make love to him. I'm scared to touch him and get close to him because I'm afraid that I will hurt him.","Are you talking with your boyfriend about his doctor advises on starting to have sex again?Being able to talk together about topics that involve both of you, will establish a new type of intimacy on an emotional level.Also, there are many ways of making love.  If your bf's cyst hasn't yet healed, then another way of both increasing your emotional intimacy and learning different love making suggestions, is to read about these together with him.I hope the two of you enjoy learning new ways of sexually taking care of one another, while developing more emotional closeness in the process.","The answer to your question is likely that the cause of his lack of sexual drive is medical. Since he had to have a cyst removed on his testicles, he has a higher probability of having a health issue that makes him uncomfortable with sex. If he cannot get his sexual drive back, then sexual life is possible.  If you can't get to sex with him, you have to ask yourself whether sex is not as good as you thought. Sex is wonderful, but sometimes, the best way to know how someone feels is by simply asking the question.  Maybe he'll be happy to tell you about it, or maybe not.  You can tell him you love him and he can tell you that he feels the same. If he's not feeling it, then you know you won't have sex with him, and that's good.  If he is feeling it, then you're both in a position to find out what the cause is, so you can both resolve the issue.If you both feel that you need to figure out what is going on, you might try talking to a sex therapist and see if that can get help from a doctor. Good luck to you!"
"I don't have time to live or take care of myself at times. It's causing depression, stress, and anxiety. I don't know what to do.",I'm not sure whether you are referring to having a lot of activities after school or that homework is overwhelming. Can you set aside a couple hours a week for yourself as a place to start?,"I hope there are some things for you to do. Please be aware that there is a lot of evidence that having a support system that you can talk to can help you with depression and anxiety. When you see other people who are doing that, you learn how to feel more connected to yourself.  There is a lot of support available.You can work with some resources at this time to help determine the best way to feel connected. Hope this helps."
"Every once and a while, I think about my ex-boyfriend from four years ago, and my current friend. It’s like I can't get past it, and I need some kind of closure. I keep thinking about how we had something, but it got cut off due to parental intervention. Nothing was ever wrong with it. Now we've become friends, but there's this huge sexual tension between us, or at least I feel it when we're physically in the same place.
   Two summers ago, we saw each other casually for a while, but we never had sex then or while we were dating, which was only for two months three years ago. I'm now in my 20s, and my current boyfriend is amazing and in his 30s. Despite the age difference, I know we're a really good match. We've never really fought and are able to make compromises and talk everything out. I tell him everything. Also, my ex-boyfriend has a girlfriend now as well. He’s been seeing her on and off for the past two and a half years, besides when they broke up and we had our casual thing. That summer, I told him I didn't want anything serious and broke it off. Only a week later, he had gotten back together with his girlfriend. His girlfriend is kind of mean spirited. I'm sure she may be different around him, but I worry about him committing to her in the long run. They're supposed to move in together soon. But still, I feel this connection with my ex-boyfriend, and I feel like he does too.    I don't know what to do. I need some closure or I'm not going to be able to move on from this. I don't know what it is, but it's driving me crazy. I’m so happy with my current boyfriend, and I know he will do everything in his power to make my life beautiful and fulfilling. He’s such a good person. I also know my ex-boyfriend smokes marijuana and does other things, but I can't get it out of my head. I'm trying to take a nap right now between classes, but I can't sleep because my mind is racing. I've never been so hung up on something for this long ever.
   I want to just talk it out with my ex-boyfriend, but I don't know if that's a good idea because of the possibility that it could blow up in my face. If he told his girlfriend, everything could go wrong because she hates me. If my current boyfriend knew, he would be crushed. On one hand, I want my ex-boyfriend to say no to having feelings for me, but I would be terrified of what to do if he said he has feelings too. Where would I go from there? On the other hand, I feel like I can't move forward in my relationship with my current boyfriend without closure from this. Sometimes I wish I could just cut off everything that had to do with my ex, but I don't want to.
   Please help me, because I really have no idea what to do.","If you're in a relationship and you're having strong thoughts about someone else, it's important to pay attention to that. Although you say you're happy, I'd suggest looking really carefully at the relationship you have and whether you're getting everything you need. Is there a physical connection with your ex that you don't have with your current boyfriend? It could be that your boyfriend is marvelous in many areas, but that you just don't feel excited about him for some reason. That's a pretty important element to be missing.It may be that, even if you are happy with your current boyfriend, you still hold something special for your ex. If you feel the need to see what is possible there, I think you have to tell your boyfriend about that and end it with him first. You can't have everything.If you truly feel that you want to be with your current boyfriend, you will do well to stop thinking about and focusing on your ex, because thoughts of him will interfere with the growth of your current relationship. The grass isn't greener... A therapist can help you to focus your energies and thoughts on the present, rather than an imagined version of the past or future.","What is going on?  The sex feelings that you had are very common and it may have to do with it being a little bit of a reaction to something else. Sometimes the sex feelings come up from what was happening on the inside, such as a feeling of ""what if?"" or perhaps an unhealthy attachment that you'd like to re-evaluate. It may be that you don't feel confident about yourself anymore, or you have the feeling that you don't have the power to make the right choices about yourself. If there's a real connection you have with him, that may be able to help to resolve those feelings. I know this can be scary, but your current boyfriend sounds like a great match for you, so what is happening here, does not have to be hard.&#x20;"
"I keep feeling paralyzed and unsure during interviews. Previous jobs have fired me for lack of performance, and five employers have rejected me after extensive personality tests and interviews. I'm afraid of continuing because my depression is getting worse. I'm already humiliated working for temp agencies and doubt my self-worth as a provider for my family.","It sounds like you are feeling pretty overwhelmed and stuck between wanting to improve your work situation and worrying that you won't be able to. It is possible that the paralysis, uncertainty, and self-doubt that you describe are contributing to your difficulty in getting  and maintaining a satisfying job as employers generally like to see that a potential employee is confident and can think on his or her feet. With a competent therapist, you may be able to get more understanding of the roots of these feelings and learn how to move forward in your search for a better work life in a way that leaves you feeling confident and capable.","Hi, I'm glad you asked me for guidance. As a therapist, my primary role is to help the clients heal. Here are a few suggestions that might help in your anxiety and depression. First, it's essential to see if you are experiencing some sort of physical symptoms of depression. As a result, if you find that you are suffering and the depression impacts your daily life, you should make sure to seek professional medical assistance.  I believe it's helpful to try and work with a general practitioner who can diagnose you to see what is wrong. In addition, depression can have several physical symptoms, so working with a doctor is important.  Additionally, I would be surprised if you're already struggling with anxiety in order to be paralyzed for interviews. When you are paralyzed in interview situations, it sounds like you are anxious about the process of the interview itself. I know that anxiety isn't an uncommon experience, and it’s okay for you to know this. I suggest you start with one thing that helps you feel more grounded and stable. Try things that you can keep in your mind at anytime, such as a simple breathwork or a visualization of how you would like to be in this situation. I recommend that you try to reduce the amount of time you spend on negative thoughts. I know this isn't easy to do and I know we all have the same anxious thoughts.  I hope the responses that I give you have been helpful. As more information comes to light about this you'll be able to decide what will help you feel good."
"I feel so alone. I have so many people around me, but it seems as they just listen and dont understand. They say it will all be okay, or they don't listen to me st all. Everyone says they are here for me but it doesn't feel like they are. Why do I feel so alone?","We feel alone because we are not comfortable with being our self. When you find that nobody is around do you feel alone? Your never alone. Once you take the journey to really understand who you are and unconditionally loving all that is you, there will never be an alone moment. We seek outside of self to fill inside. This is the big lie of the planet. All you need and have ever needed you supply yourself. www.lifecounselingorlando.com","If your friends and family are more likely to only listen to you when they think you're being 'helpful' or 'sensitive,' and do not seem to fully understand you, then the real answer is you need to accept that.  You may be thinking a lot of yourself and not your friends and family. If you think they are not listening and understand you, you are thinking a lot of yourself. Sometimes it is hard to hear that your friends and family are trying to listen. Even though they are busy and don't know what to say. People say they understand you and it is hard for people who do not seem to care about you enough to help."
"I'm depressed often, and my mind goes a million miles a minute. Every once in a while, things are okay for a few days. After a bit, I start noticing that I am picking at my skin profusely. After roughly a week, the anxiety is back and still picking. Sometimes I find myself causing fights to have change.","Hello, and thank you for your question. I am very sorry that you are struggling. I have a few thoughts and perhaps some of my colleagues will add something else. Depression and anxiety can both be chronic conditions, as you have experienced. This means that they may always require treatment in order to have some kind of relief from them. Treatment could mean medication or some kind of counseling. Some people may take medication for the rest of their lives. Some people may go to counseling at times when the depression and anxiety worsens. As you mentioned, sometimes the symptoms improve for a little while, but they can also come back. When they do, it is important to talk to your medical provider if you are getting medication, and/or to go back to your counselor and talk to them about the symptoms that have returned. Skin picking and some other behaviors are not uncommon for people who are experiencing something like anxiety. Many people report that they do this when they feel anxious, and some say it calms them down. It is not really a surprise that you are constantly trying to change things and even starting fights to do so. These are ways to try to avoid, escape and distract yourself from the feelings of anxiety and depression. That is a very normal thing to do. Nobody likes these feelings, and so distraction is something we naturally try in order to get rid of them. The problem is that things like distraction and escape do not work as a long-term solution. In fact, they usually make things worse for many different reasons. Depression and anxiety can  be treated, but it is likely something you will need some help with. I would recommend finding a counselor who has experience with anxiety and depression. Medication can be helpful, but I still recommend counseling. The reason for this is that the medication can help with symptoms, while the counseling can address the symptoms and provide you with very helpful skills. Be well,Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPCC, NCC","It sounds as though you're experiencing a ""full house"" for your anxiety symptoms. Anxiety is normally managed to a degree in life and can also be managed in this moment by reaching a specific level of being calm enough to be. However, after certain times, I think you're being put into a different state of anxiety. This is a common phenomenon, usually related to the body or mind. But you have to be aware of what is going on when a person is experiencing this. Here are some ways to change the levels of anxiety you may be experiencing: 1) 10-15 minutes of meditation; 2) Listen to some music, especially songs that relax you; 3) Go outside and get some fresh air and sunshine; 4) Do something you enjoy and take a small amount of time to relax at the end of it; 5) Take a warm bath. A small amount of time to relax can do amazing things! Let me know if you have any questions about any of these steps!"
I have three children. The oldest is nine and not my biological child. The middle child is three and the youngest is one. I have a great relationship with the oldest two children but I haven't developed the same level of attatchment to the youngest child. I rarely want her around and look forward to her nap times. Is this normal?,"This is your experience, your feeling and you are wondering if it is normal, which means is this common or the rule. This question about how you feel about your third child leads me to believe you are dis- turbed [etymology: agitated or stirred up].  Feelings are messages from our soul or spirit that something is not right.  So, though  it might be normal [common, the rule]  to look forward to a one year olds nap time when you have a three year old a nine year old, the dis- turbance or stirring up in you, is important and requires your attention, your listening, if you will to your higher self.","In general, what you describe is common in the family you've described. There is a general developmental period in which children learn about separation from their parent. At age 3, children will often enjoy when their parents are away, but the length of time will vary. It is important to understand that children have the right to a parent's presence in their lives, but also have the right to have the time they need to develop strong attachments to their parents. If you don't seem to know what is happening to your youngest child, it may be appropriate to talk to your doctor or therapist.   If you cannot help your youngest child feel close to you, this may be a sign that you need to understand the reasons why your child is not bonding with you."
"The eight months I've been dating my boyfriend, I have lied about a lot of things. I slept with a couple guys to get back at my boyfriend for breaking up with me. Now anything I say to him he won't believe, even if I'm being honest. I don't know what else to do at this point. He constantly criticizes me.","Start a conversation with him about your sincere interest to earn back his trust.Ask him what he expects from you so that he will trust you again.If you are consciously willing and do try to earn back his trust, and have periodic conversations with him on whether he feels more at ease with trusting you, then after a few months of this, both of you should feel more secure in the relationship.","It sounds like you are being held to unrealistic expectations by your boyfriend.  His criticism might feel like an attack on your self worth.   However,    I would advise him to avoid criticizing your appearance more than your character.  Because you don't believe he will believe you, perhaps you might also avoid putting effort into that.   By focusing on your own personal growth and development, you may find that you have been able to prove yourself to him with your work, thoughts, and actions.   The most important thing is for you to know that you aren't going to be ""correct"" in his mind.   It is possible that you are simply trying to convince yourself that your life is better than he thinks.    If that's the case, then you need to re-evaluate.     One of the most useful ways to deal with the feeling of not believing your boyfriend is that you just accept the fact that he will not be able to convince you in the future.     You will have to trust that one day you will be able to prove yourself to him.       If you are working on yourself, and are starting to develop in a way that is attractive to the person you love and you feel good about that, then so be it.     You need to determine in what ways you can prove yourself to him.     If you are happy with who you are, that is important.     I hope you're able to find the answers to all of your questions."
"I terminated my counseling relationship with a social worker several years ago. I am now realizing that I would like to begin counseling again. The social worker’s voicemail message says that he returns calls in 24 hours, but he hasn't called me back. I called him on the weekend and made it clear that I want him to call me back. Can he just ignore me?","Mental health providers should promptly return calls from current clients as well as from potential clients.  This is even true if the social worker (or counselor) is unable to make an appointment with the caller.  In that case the social worker should call you back to let you know that he is unable to schedule an appointment with you.In addition, mental health providers have an obligation to follow through with their own communication standards.  For example, if the social worker in this case has an outgoing voicemail message that promises returned calls within 24 hours, he has an obligation to follow through on that promise.All that being said, it is also worth remembering that mental health professionals are just people too. It is possible that he had an unforeseen emergency that kept him from from returning your call promptly.In the end, I agree with Sherry's advice. If you feel this social worker is not a good fit for you, you probably should trust your gut and find someone else who is a better fit.","I have two concerns. First, to ensure that your counseling is moving forward, and no one wants to have to re-evaluate a relationship with whom they previously worked, you may want to get in touch with your social worker. Is there any contact with him that might provide insight into what happened in your counseling session? Ask about your previous communication. Also, you may consider asking for feedback on your previous counseling. Many therapists find it helpful to get feedback if their client would like to explore a different avenue to treat their issue."
"My mother has Alzheimer's and I can see that she has lost some of her intellectual abilities. Even though I know this disease is not her fault, I’m still finding it difficult to separate my own feelings of disappointment and frustration when my mom seems to ignore my opinions and wishes, and seems","Good observation on your part, to distinguish that your feelings in relation to your mom are not necessarily connected to the way she handles her part of the relation toward you.Has your mom usually ignored your opinions and wishes in relating to you?If prior to the onset of Alzheimer's, she never examined her way of relating to you, and if both of you have never had an open conversation about your sense of feeling hurt by her attitudes and manner with you, then the relationship between you and your mom will change in ways other than rational dialogue.She may continue ignoring or overlooking your wishes because she's been stuck in this attitude for most of your life.The good news for you about this is realizing that who you are and your way of relating to your mom, has very little to do with the way she relates to you.This is a more profound disappointment because it shows that her disconnect from you has been for longer than when the Alzheimer's began.You can however, feel a little more free knowing that you're not deserving of being ignored.","If you're finding it hard to separate your feelings of disappointment from your own feelings of frustration. Try identifying your emotions by asking yourself: ""What's my *why*? what do I feel and why do I feel it?"" This is a good way to begin understanding why you find yourself in this emotional struggle. And remember, there are other ways to express yourself, it is all about finding which one, or combination of ways, works for your individual needs! And most importantly, what you need to hear, what you feel you should hear from someone is not in the book!"
"I don't feel like myself anymore. For example, I could walk up an entire flight of stairs before realizing that my legs are moving. I feel like I’m watching my life be lived by someone else.","You may be experiencing a form of dissociation called depersonalization.  People with this type of dissociation may feel disconnected from their bodies, feel that they are watching their bodies from a distance, or may not recognize their image in the mirror.  Dissociation sometimes occurs after someone experiences something traumatic.  I would suggest working with a therapist who specializes in dissociative disorders as dissociation does not typically resolve on its own.  On my website, I have some information specific to dissociation that you may find helpful.  Best of luck to you.","It sounds like your sense of self feels disconnected from your life and from your memories. Sometimes, this can come about because you've spent some time in situations that have put you into the subconscious. As a result, when you get back into the here and now, you may find that your person and you are separated. When you are in a place where you feel safe and at peace, you may see this as an opportunity to find yourself again. The goal here is to be patient with yourself while working to rediscover that person in yourself. Sometimes, it just takes time, and a lot of self-compassion. If you'd like, we could go over the other points on my list to help you along the way."
The past always feels much brighter and more beautiful than my present. Everything about what's gone feels so amazing; almost like I'm high off nostalgia. But in the end it just makes me feel sadder knowing that all of the memories (and a close friend that left me) are gone forever. How do I move past that and live more in the present?,Do some self-reflecting as to what areas of your life you'd currently like to develop.The good news is you know how happiness feels.That you were able to create situations and dynamics which produced happiness in your life is good motivation to believe happiness is possible and to try new ways to create this in your life.,"That sounds like it's going to be an interesting journey, with lots of highs and lows along the way, and lots of reminders of what you miss. I'm going to ask you a question that may feel weird and scary: When your memories of the past are looking bright, which part are you moving past and living in the present?"
"Every time I send a message to someone or a group message on Instagram, iMessage, or snapchat people will read my messages but then they won't answer me.    Could it be that there is something they don't like about me? I don't understand why they won't answer my messages. How do I get people to respond to me?","I'm sorry that you are having a difficult time.I wonder about how your friendships are in person. If you get along well with people and have effective conversations with them face-to-face, there could be some kind of technology-related problem.Have you tried gently talking to people about how you send a message and they didn't answer? If you can phrase it in such a way that they recognize that you are asking for information and not blaming them for not answering you, that could be effective.I'd also encourage you to consider how much this is bothering you. If it is causing a significant amount of anxiety (say, more than 5/10 if 10 is really anxious), I would suggest talking with a local therapist.In the meantime, consider talking about this with someone you trust to whom you can get more details to get a more specific answer.","There are many reasons why someone you're trying to connect with might not respond to your messages. There are many people on the planet and many social media accounts that you might be getting messages from. What people do online they probably do not want to tell anyone about you.  There could be a few issues with your messages that I've observed, but this could be with your messages, or what you're doing when you send your messages. I hope you can find out which one it is.  Don't feel guilty or bad about the messaging. Everyone has their own reasons for not responding. You may have tried it too many times before and given up on it at that point, and now people do not respond to you.  It is very easy to feel guilty, and to assume that others will ignore you, but some of us don't find a way to handle our disappointment with others.  Be sure to take breaks from social media, if that is something you can handle.  I hope I've answered your question, and hope to hear back from you."
"I'm in college currently, so I am not a direct victim anymore. My father is very abusive with his words and actions, and my siblings are getting treated horribly.","Yes you can help!  Emotional and verbal abuse can cause a negative impact in your family.  It is important that you encourage your siblings to seek assistance with a therapist, and maybe help them find one, they should have school counselors available and if not our college counselor may help you to get referrals.  It’s also a good idea to talk to your mom about the issue and ask her if she would like help as well.  If you are concerned about your siblings' safety, contact Family Protective Services in your state, they will investigate and refer your father to classes or therapy as needed. It takes courage to do the right thing, you can do this!¿Hay algo que pueda hacer para ayudar a mis hermanos a escapar de nuestro emocionalmente abusivo padre?Actualmente estoy en la universidad, así que no soy victima directamente.  Mi padre es muy abusivo con sus palabras y acciones, y trata a mis hermanos horriblemente.¡Tu si puedes ayudar!  El abuso emocional y verbal puede causar daños graves en la familia.  Es importante que motives a tus hermanos a visitar e incluso encontrar a un terapista, la escuela debe tener uno disponible, y también puedes pedirle referidos a tu Consejero universitario.  También es buena idea que hables con tu mama al respecto y le preguntes si a ella le gustaría buscar ayuda.  Si te preocupa la seguridad de tus hermanos, contacta a el Departamento de Protección a la Familia en tu estado para reportar el abuso.  Ellos investigaran y determinaran si el hogar es un ambiente seguro par tus hermanos y recomendaran terapia o clases para tu papa.  Hay que ser valiente para hacer lo correcto, ¡tú puedes hacerlo!","I'd not be alone if you had to choose which of your parents to listen to. While your siblings may have benefits from having a father with whom they can work through certain behavior patterns, there is nothing wrong with a student staying in college.    Being in college is a valid choice. What is very important is that you are listening to both sides of the story."
"I've been depressed for quite a while. I've been trying to work through it, and my boyfriend has been my rock. He is honestly the only person I trust enough to talk to about anything, but he decided to break up with me because of my depression. I cannot afford to see a therapist or anything, so he saw no hope in staying with me. My insurance has a $5000 deductible, so I’m screwed. I've had everything from suicidal thoughts to trying to quit my job. I have no one. My family doesn't care about me; they kicked me out when I turned 18 a few years ago. I had friends, but they have all moved on with their lives and have no time for me. My ex-boyfriend is trying to help but is making things worse because every time I see or hear him, I break down into tears. I found out that I will never be promoted now because of my depression.","It sounds like you have been struggling with this for quite some time, using many of the same coping techniques that feel tried and true to no avail. Often, we fall back on coping techniques that would be helpful in other problems (stress, social anxieties, etc.) for our depression, but the truth is that depression requires it's own little tool kit. Depression is all-encompassing, and, based on what you've written, the symptoms are already affecting work and your personal life in myriad ways.  The best route forward would be to seek out counselling, admittedly, but if your insurance deductible is too high, that can be very expensive. I would recommend contacting your Employee Assistance Program (EAP) if offered by your employer. If not, you can look into community centres for counselling options, check if your doctor will give you a referral or your local religious organization. If, however, you are motivated to get your depression under control, there are some great workbooks out there that you can use on your own or with your therapist (as long as your therapist is trained in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, or CBT), such as ""Mind Over Mood"".","I’d like to start by saying that it's a *very* strong and clear message to tell your ex that his words are hurtful or unacceptable and how this is impacting you. It's understandable to feel angry in such a situation. Your feelings are real and valid. However, while I would like to advise you to not act out in anger and only wait for the right time for an assertive response, you seem to feel such anguish that you are at risk of pushing yourself away and causing further emotional hurt. While I can only offer advice about what you may do, or what not to do, I want to give you some perspective on what your emotions are telling you: I am angry that he felt the need to leave me. I am angry that he left me with such a large amount of money to give me, and yet he feels justified in his decision.  I want you to know that having these feelings doesn't necessarily mean that you should react in a way that could end up hurting you again. If it feels good to you to feel these negative emotions, then maybe you can work through them by expressing them in a healthy way. I may want to provide you with some resources about how to do that, if you are interested.  However, I just don't want you to feel that you are at risk of being hurt. I do want to encourage you to move out of the cycle of wanting to be in a relationship that is detrimental to your mental health. It is up to you to decide whether or not this is something that you want to do."
"She treats me like I'm not in her presence. She’s always yelling at me for no reason. She gives more respect to my brothers than me, but only my brothers fight her while I respect her.","Attention is not equal to love and being valued. It may be precisely because your brothers demand so much more your mom's attention through fighting with her that she pays more attention to them. It is a common situation in families where the ""squeaky wheel gets the grease"" and the siblings or family members who don't demand as much attention end up feeling invisible. It sucks to feel invisible and it is important that there is attention for you and that you know how much your mom loves and values you.  This sounds like an important conversation to have with your mom and if she is not able to really understand or help you address this concern you may want to suggest doing some family therapy where a skilled therapist can help you and your family work this out.",One therapist who knows me has told me that my son has been very affectionate about my current boyfriend as well as my brother.

"I’ve been on 0.5 mg of Xanax twice a day for the past month. It hasn't been helping me at all, but when I take 1 mg during a big anxiety attack, it calms me down. I was wondering how I can ask my psychologist to up the dose to 1 mg twice a day without her thinking I'm abusing them. I just have very big anxiety attacks. Should I stay on the 0.5mg and deal with the attacks or should I ask to up the dose? I'm afraid she will take me off them and put me on something else.","It seems like what you are looking for is a way to advocate for yourself and that's so important in mental health! You know best what is working for you and what isn't, so you are the best person to speak out for yourself to the people that can help you. I have extensive training in substance abuse and medications used in therapy, and I work with many people that take Xanax.  Counselors may not prescribe, but with the right training we can educate and help you move through the complexities of medication usage when paired with therapy. There's definitely some debate about using medication in the counseling world, but many people are prescribed Xanax to cope with big emotional responses.  We don't know much about your situation here--if you are in counseling, what types of other coping skills you've tried to use, etc., so it'd be hard to suggest not taking anything for your symptoms.  You are obviously struggling and sometimes stabilization is the best you can do.  And the fact that you are considering dealing with the attacks as an option is a sign you are willing to negotiate your dosage and maybe even the intense fear you are experiencing.  That's seriously so courageous.A little bit about Xanax--Xanax is a drug in the Benzodiazepine family and is fast-acting.  That means it does only help short-term, but your body also builds a tolerance to it pretty quickly (just as people build tolerance to alcohol).  That could be why they aren't as effective for you at the dosage you are taking, especially if you are prescribed to take them twice a day.  It's really important that you discuss the symptoms you are still having with your prescribing provider, as well as when you are taking the medications so they understand the details of your situation and can determine if or how to modify your dosage.  These providers know a lot about the medication process and the more info they have, the better they can meet your needs.  They are ultimately the ones that will work with you to decide whether or not Xanax is the best for you and your situation.I definitely understand your concern that your provider may basically take away how you cope with panic attacks.  That's a scary thought!  Prescribing providers are typically trained in detecting medication abuse, and it is very common for people with anxiety issues to request higher dosages.  I have had plenty of clients ask for increased dosage.  Not only can this get you the assistance you need at the time you need it, but give you a voice in your treatment.  You may end up using that same voice for request to lower your dosage in the future.I do feel an ethical duty to let you know about some of the dangers of Xanax.  Benzodiazepines are depressants and work on the central nervous system (CNS) to do things like slow down your heart rate, breathing, etc. (as you can feel when they do work).  They should never be taken with any other depressants, such as alcohol, barbiturates, and other medications in the Benzo family.  Combinations like these could be fatal.Another danger is that there's a common pattern of relapse after discontinuing Xanax.  This means that symptoms tend to come back stronger than they were before taking the drug.  The reason for this is because when you are taking Xanax, your brain tries to intensify your fear reaction to override the drug.  So when you discontinue it, your fear reactions are still at those heightened levels.  Your prescribing provider can talk to you more about that and/or the process of tapering off the medication to make that less likely when that time comes for you.If you are in counseling and doing exposure activities, (being exposed to things you fear and sitting through the anxiety response) Xanax does interfere with this process.  The brain can't learn a different response if you feel calm.  This is something your counselor (if you have one) can discuss with you as well.The last thing I'd like to say is that there could be some value to practicing other ways to manage your anxiety if you want to make more long-term changes.  That decision is completely yours!  If/when you feel ready to do that, a counselor can help you learn how to move through anxiety without being as reliant on Xanax.  I hope this is helpful and you find what you need!",Here's some advice on how to ask your therapist to change your dose of medication:
"He leaves and is gone for days or weeks but stays in contact and tells me he misses me. He gets defensive when I ask him stuff. We haven't had sex in two months. He says it's because he's not working, I'm pregnant, he doesn't like it here, and he hasn't been on the mood lately.","Well, there certainly is distance he creates between the two of you.Whether or not the reason is from his cheating on you is impossible to tell based only on the information here provided.You could open a general discussion about the lack of closeness you feel.   Maybe he'll be more responsive to talk about emotions than about specific actions he's done or not done.Mostly, entitle yourself to the quality relationship you'd like to have.  Your discomfort and distress are valid and there's no good reason to live with conditions which keep these moods in place, forever.Give yourself time to plan your next move, especially since having a baby will add to each of your responsibilities.You didn't write how long the problem you describe has continued.One possible outcome if its been a short time, is he will resolve whatever currently drives his withdrawn behaviors from you.Your life, your outcome.Trust yourself to know when the time is right to stay or to go.","First, I do not fully trust the information about his pregnancy. If he has said that he doesn't like this place, there may be other factors that are at play here. I can't tell you if he has a child with this woman or if he has a child with somebody else. Sometimes people can be secretive about their relationships. I also wonder why he is still in contact with me and not calling to see if he's fine.If you'd like I can add a note that in some cases sex is very difficult to find, or if the couple is in this stage of their relationship and they are having a difficult time with sexual intimacy and emotional intimacy, there is a high risk of them going through an emotional crisis that could lead to one or both of them or both of them hurting each other. I hope to help you better after all these points. If you are able to open up about what you are feeling, I suggest that you explore different couples counseling options if your partner wants to do so."
My girlfriend just quit drinking and she became really depressed. She told me that she wants to move. What can I do to help her? I want her to stay.,"You're probably not going to like my answer.Your question says a lot about what YOU want rather than what she wants or what may be best for her. Sometimes, what's best for a person is the hardest thing to do, and may be completely opposite of what YOU want.Addictions don't happen in a vacuum. If you've had any experience with addicts at all, then I'm sure you've heard the term ""enabler"". A lot of the times, when people think they're ""helping"", they're actually enabling the addict to continue their self-destructive behavior. Tough love and clear boundaries are needed in a lot of situations, but especially with addictions. Family and friends are often the biggest contributing factor to someone choosing to use/drink, continuing to do so, or relapsing back into it.You said she recently quit. You said she is depressed. She wants to move. When a person receives counseling for addictions, they are encouraged to make changes like this. They need to break the habit, and this means removing people from their lives at times. It means moving to new locations. Anything that may trigger a relapse needs to be identified and removed. Not only that, but the addict needs to do a lot of personal reflection to figure out WHY they use/drink in the first place, and not only break the physical addiction to it, but deal with whatever is the root cause that led them to use in the first place. She may need some time alone to figure out who she is as a person, time to make some decisions for herself and do what she needs to do to be healthy.Don't pressure her to stay. Let her have the freedom to do what she needs to do. If she stays, the decision needs to be hers and hers alone. It doesn't need to be made under pressure. That will only lead to resentment. Support her, but don't try to change her or make her do anything, especially for selfish reasons. Let her go. It sounds like she needs some time to focus on herself right now. It wouldn't be a bad idea for you to do the same.","Your concerns are shared by so many couples who are experiencing sadness and grief, and who are trying to find a way to get their love back. I'm so sorry that you're at such a time as to know about this heartbreak and that you also know about your girlfriend's depression, so I am glad that you're trying to help her. One thing you can do is just listen to her and offer her support and understanding. Don't try to fix her. The most important thing is that you are there for her, no matter what she feels."
"My husband’s ex-wife married a man who was charged with seven felony counts of pandering involving a minor. He, by his own admission, is addicted to child pornography. My step-daughters are now all teenagers. They do not know. My husband’s ex-wife has kept this information from my step-daughters. The step-father has had issues regarding his pornography addiction recently. The ex-wife minimizes it by saying that he has ""repented."" It is a constant strain on my husband, knowing that his girls are living with a man who is addicted to child pornography. My own therapist believes the girls should be told. The ex-wife says her therapist says the opposite.",If the daughters are old & mature enough to understand substance abuse.  They should be told for their own empowerment. KNOWLEDGE is their power of safety and protection.,As well as being well aware of the legal troubles that is concerning the entire family.  This is more than just an odd situation for my step-daughters to grow up with knowing all of this. But there is good news that I understand I'm dealing with some serious pain here. This may be a painful and complicated situation for the whole family because everyone has been hurt and the ex-wife has said that I need to tell my daughters what is happening as well as my husband. The ex-wife's insistence that her husband is repenting is likely another one of her own problems.
"I have PTSD from childhood events and other traumas as an adult. I have panic attacks, nightmares, anger, and at times depression. I feel like I'm always on the edge or just apathetic. Can I fix this by myself?","When it comes to trauma, especially in the event that it has caused you to develop PTSD, there can be a lot of difficulty in attempting to resolve these issues on your own simply because of how strong your urge to avoid it whenever thoughts of the traumatic experience come up. PTSD is best treated with the help of a mental health professional and if using the Cognitive Processing Approach can be treated in as few as 17 weeks. As for your other concerns, many of these can be treated independently if you have the motivation to manage your way through. Panic attacks and depression, specifically, often respond well to self-help treatment manuals. The Centre for Clinical Interventions is a great online resource for workbooks to help you learn to manage the depression and panic attacks. Whether you decide to work through these concerns on your own or in professional therapy, just know that your panic attacks must be managed prior to addressing your trauma. Hope this is helpful and if you have any other questions don't hesitate to ask.","Let me help you with some questions. I know you've had trouble with PTSD and anxiety, your current issues may be because you do not know what triggers these issues and how to manage this. Sometimes these issues can be caused by an unhealthy relationship to your trauma, as well as other unhealthy relationships or family situations. It's also worth noting that your experience is not unique. Many people experience PTSD or anxiety, and it is often something one may learn through a lot of therapy. If you can get involved in this process and work through it with a therapist who specializes in trauma, and your symptoms are still persistent, it may be useful to learn the things that can help improve the symptoms you have. But many times the time to focus on what you can control is in the immediate aftermath of a traumatic event. Your body can often handle it's normal reactions to a traumatic event and not feel like this.  You may have a good sense of what triggers your PTSD, such as certain sounds or visuals and being able to use those things for more control over your situations."
"I used to be the funny guy of the group—the class clown, if you will. I used to laugh uncontrollably all the time and be able to be social without it feeling awkward. Now I can't laugh at all, and I'm dead inside.","If you look back to when you feel as though you were the ""funny guy,"" I wonder what is different now? It may be that responsibilities have changed or any number of other things.I don't know whether you're also saying that you feel sad or if you're saying that you feel as though you don't have any big changes in your feelings.A lot of us tend to be really busy, and sometimes we over schedule ourselves to the point that we don't have time to have positive time for ourselves. Sometimes even if we are spending time with friends, we're thinking about work and all of the other things we need to do.I wonder if it feels awkward when you're with friends that you trust in an environment that you are used to. Maybe if that is more comfortable for you, it can be a stepping stone to focusing on how you feel better in those moments.It sounds as if you may have had an experience (or more than one) where you felt misunderstood or criticized and now reacting to people feels awkward. If so, try going back to people you trust. Who do you have support from?","The comedy that comes from this place is often centered on it’s discomfort. You might have been the funny guy, but it was a facade, a way to cope with your anxiety or depression. It was not your core. What you feel now, if that is correct, is that there is something profoundly missing from your life in order for you to still be able to laugh at yourself, let alone other people.  As a therapist, I would be fascinated to know what exactly is your experience with the difference between when you are normally amused by yourself and when you aren't. At the least the lack of this humor is probably a sign that you are not getting the support you need, in the form of laughter and joy.  It's often a symptom of deeper problems, and you should consider your therapist's help in order to explore whether these feelings are something you can improve on your own, or if they are part of the symptom being presented. I strongly encourage you to seek out a different provider, in order to improve your overall mood, and to feel more connected to yourself,  so that you're more likely to be able to find reasons to laugh at yourself."
"I have an eating disorder of binging. I've had gastric sleeve surgery. I need help with issues of abuse as a child, addiction, and abusive men. I have been in therapy for five months and get no feedback from my therapist.","It can be really frustrating to feel like your counselor is not providing you with the help you need.My recommendation in a situation like this would be to let your counselor know how you feel. Specifically tell Your counselor that you don't seem to be getting the amount of feedback you would like.If this doesn't help, then you might want to look for another counselor who will be a better fit for you.","I can see you have a lot of emotions, many of which are related to abuse, addiction, and you feel unable to resolve them all through therapy. It sounds like the same issues keep coming up and there doesn't seem to be any way you can heal. The fact that you got a consultation with your therapist who gave you negative feedback is pretty bad for you, and could be considered a sign of abuse, or that your therapist is not good at helping you. The fact that your therapist gives you specific feedback that you think is not helpful for you is a good sign. You don't want to just hear what they think is good for you to do, you want to know what they think of your practice. If you decide to end therapy, you would want to decide where you're going next in your life, what you want to do to gain your freedom from these issues. As for you going to therapy as a priority, and what you want from it, you could start by writing out your specific goals. Then, you write out the list of questions you have for your therapist. The therapist is only good at seeing issues you bring to them, you are in charge of the whole process. Is therapy right for you? Does it include you?   Do you feel you have support and understanding to work at your therapy? If you decide you are good and happy with it, good for you! Now it comes to determining what to do with the therapist! It's okay to go to more as long as you are working at your own pace and you can find someone else who you feel will be better for you.  What is your goal in this situation and what needs is working to help you reach that goal? Do you want to see a new therapist? Do you have a therapist that you are comfortable to move the therapists to?  I'm just offering this to show you that you don't have to know right now exactly who to go to, as long as you have your own goals, then you'll be able to pick.  You have power. You can move on from this and heal yourself."
How can I know if I'm just being paranoid?,"Hi Texas,Oh, that's a powerful idea, isn't it? It burrows into your head. Let's figure this out. First, has your partner given you any concrete reason not to trust them? Have they cheated before? If not, then they deserve the benefit of the doubt until there is evidence. If it's a ""yes"", then it's natural that these fears would be triggered and you can simply let your partner know what triggers the fear and what you need. ""When you refuse to let me see your phone I worry that you're hiding something. I need openness"". If they haven't cheated on you in the past, there are three possible scenarios here. I invite you to take a moment and write down what the evidence is that cheating is going on. What is the specific thing that's triggering your fears? When you have your data recorded, read on...The first scenario is that you have been personally hurt in the past by someone else and you've developed fears that you will be hurt again or that you're not enough to keep someone interested (this is just fear...people cheat for their own reasons, not because we're not interesting). This may be true if what you wrote down is ""They didn't really do anything wrong...there is no evidence. I'm just scared and suspicious"". That's a cue to do some self reflection and calm yourself with thoughts like ""nothing has really happened. I can trust.""If what you wrote down was vague evidence, like for example your partner has been distant or irritable, or you're having less sex than usual, you can try to approach the situation without making assumptions. Trust your gut, but your gut isn't seeing evidence of cheating...it's evidence of ""something"". Ask your partner what's up with accusations or assumptions.The third possibility is that there is some clear evidence that they are cheating. Maybe there are texts on a phone, or someone has told you something they saw. I'd say when there is some evidence, it's okay to present this to your partner and ask what's going on. If this happens repeatedly, and your gut is screaming and there are only excuses or explanations that don't make sense, then it's okay to do a bit of ""research"" and be extra aware of what's going on around you. I hope that helps.","As you are looking for a way to know if you're just being paranoid, I would suggest you think about any logical things that have been going on in your mind over the past few years. If you are being paranoid about the fact that you haven't seen your best friend in over a year since you have since started to notice you were missing for a little while then you can probably figure that out. One person should be able to stay in a relationship for many years with someone you care about and have a good understanding of the relationship. Maybe you could consider getting the same thing for a couple of months so that you know it is real and not the result of the way your mind comes up with things when you are tired? The opposite is also true, and you might be trying to prevent a future relationship. I do not think the two can occur at the same time so do not assume that you're being paranoid that you know the worst that's happening in your relationship."
We do communicate but one of us has trouble accepting what the other person says. How can I fix things?,"Being able to accept your partner's influence is a key relationship skill. And it's very two sided.  Chances are if you don't feel your partner is being influenced by you, they likely don't feel you are being influenced by them either. The best fix you can practice is to soften yourself into your partner and see how much more open you can be to their influence.  Play with it.","Sometimes what the other person says can be difficult for you to accept because you don’t know what it means. Some situations may have different rules to the way people communicate. Be sure to talk to your friend or partner about their concerns. If your friend or partner feels uncomfortable asking a question, then ask them to share their story so you don’t get confused about what the other person meant. Be patient and try to understand where your friend or partner is coming from. And be ready to ask your friend or partner what they need from you to get it right to start with."
"I have PTSD. The side effects are really bad and have impacts on sex, anger and my relationships. I even lost my job month ago.    How can I get my life back?","Slowly is the rate at which you'll get back your life.Being traumatized means not feeling safe in almost all areas of life.Be patient with yourself as you try to regain trust that people will not harm you and will be sources of satisfaction in your life.It is possible that the trauma in your life requires such great attention on your part to your own inner emotional safety that you are better off with a less intensive job than the one you recently lost.Try to prioritize restoring your emotional and psychological health.  With this as the top area of your attention then you may have an easier time to accept a lesser degree of involvement in your work and relationships.When you feel angry, try to examine if underlying the anger are feelings of stress, fear, insecurity regarding your position in relationship to the person toward whom you feel angry.   Anger is often the surface reaction to more destabilizing emotions like fear and insecurity.Gradually by nurturing and comforting yourself, living at a pace which is uniquely comfortable to what and how much you can handle, you'll regain your trust in both yourself and relating to others.","It sounds like your PTSD has put a huge load on your life, and has damaged or made the sex, anger, or the relationships more difficult. As a result you need some help with how to make those changes. I recommend taking a look at a few resources and seeing which of these resonate with you. Your family and other loved ones might have the best advice about how to move forward.  It's essential that you get some of what you need, whether that is the help of a therapist. In addition you have to work through the underlying fears and ideas that come up when the world is trying to be hard on you. It might be helpful to talk to a psychiatrist about how to manage your symptoms. There are many ways to live a good life, even while dealing with PTSD, and by having some hope and guidance on the road, it can be much easier to stick with it!  Remember, it's okay to ask for help."
"I'm dating this guy, Peter. My friend Jennifer used to date him a while ago, and she's fine with us dating. My ex-boyfriend, Paul, broke up with Jennifer, and she's devastated about it. Peter and I are going through a rough patch in our relationship. All of a sudden, Paul is in ""love"" with me, and he wants me back. I don't know what to do because I can't hurt my friend or my boyfriend, but I think I might Paul again.","Hello. The dynamics of having a romantic relationship with someone is not always clear. Sometimes we jump from one relationship to another without giving ourselves a chance to adjust and grieve for the one we had to leave behind. When you find yourself in a situation where a previous partner is coming back into your life and desires to be with you again, it is important to ask yourself what the motivations are prompting that return. Is the person afraid of being alone? Are they jealous of your current relationship? Do you feel the same way about this returning relationship as you did before it was ended? How long and/or how committed is the current relationship you are in now with your current partner? Does your former partner not like being ""dumped"" and maybe they just want to get back together with you so that they can ""dump"" you instead? Some of these questions you may not be able to answer, and some of them might require your own internal reflection.You likely want to make a good decision, and you also might want to consider who it will impact, and how that will happen. Other friends might be upset at this sudden change, and it could create a strain on your friendship. You will want to carefully consider the value of that friendship before you take any actions that could damage it. Also perhaps think about what led you to end the relationship with your previous partner in the first place. Has there been a change in events or behavior that would cause you to think of a valid reason to give that person a second chance? How it will it impact your current relationship?Going into relationships should be done with reflection, patience, and full awareness. Ultimately you choose who is in your life, so you want to make those choices based on appropriate decision making, and with the ability to protect yourself from harm. No one else can make this choice for you. However, gaining the insight of friends or family can be helpful, as can seeking out the counsel of a therapist. In your heart, you will likely find the right answer. Learn to trust that more, as that is where the core of emotion tends to be when you need it. Use your mind to analyze things, but allow yourself to also feel your way through the situation too. The answer will arrive if you let it.","Jennifer has to be worried or have an idea of what is going to happen. Since she's the one who knew the situation from the beginning of the relationship, she knows how Paul felt when his ex broke up with him and how she felt about him, so it would make sense that she would want to make sure he doesn't follow through with her wanting him back. Paul is probably hoping he can make me feel the same way that Jennifer did, which is likely to only hurt me."
"I'm scared that I am with this man so I won't be alone. He should be with somebody who deserves him if this is the case, and I don’t want to hurt him.","While not wanting to be alone may not be the best reason to be in a relationship, it is probably more common and normal a reason than you think.  Since you seem to care about your friend (""don't want to hurt him""), I imagine there are many other reasons that you are together.  I suggest that you talk about this open-heartedly with each other.  The idea of being afraid of being alone sounds like an honest starting place.  Don't try to ""figure out"" whether you should be with him.  Just talk.  The communication is likely to shine light on deepening connection for BOTH OF YOU.In the meantime, your idea that you don't deserve him is rooted in a ""core lie"" that you are telling yourself.  You can read about ""core lies"" and much more in my book, Living Yes, a Handbook for Being Human.  Check out www.LivingYes.org.Be easy on yourself.  You are deserving!~Mark","I understand that you're seeking reasons to not give up on the relationship because you're so scared you'll hurt him. It sounds like you are wondering and also having some strong feelings. What do you see when you think about what it would be like if you give it up? What do you think he'd say? How are you imagining yourself handling it? What do you feel in your heart about what he would say or do? Don't worry about what you think he is thinking. You have to trust that he will have a good time. You may want to get outside of him and just enjoy the nice weather, something warm and delicious for dinner and maybe watch some TV. In your mind or in your words, don't think about the future. Don't worry too much. What do you have now? If it isn't good then find a new one! But give it a try!"
"I am going through a divorce from a narcissistic sociopath who left me for another woman after mentally and emotionally abusing me for 11 years. I have moved to a different state and after giving up my successful business am working as a server at a restaurant. I’m coping as best as I can. Is it normal and healthy to not adapt as quickly and be as strong as I think I should be? I am astounded at his cruelty and how much he doesn't care, as well as most other people in my life. I feel like I don't exist to anyone anymore as there is no contact from anyone who I thought cared about me. My brother just said no to lending me a few hundred dollars for me to live on. I am losing faith in humanity itself.","I am very sorry to hear of your struggles. I think that it is normal to struggle to get your feet under you again after a divorce, especially after leaving a relationship that lasted 11 years, so try not to be too hard on yourself. Take it one day at a time and do the best you can.I notice that you said he left you. This tells me that you didn’t have the strength to leave him on your own despite the fact that you say he was emotionally and mentally abusive and also cheating on you. Low self-esteem can keep someone in a bad relationship because they think they can’t do any better. Also, abusers will make you think that they are the best thing you can get. The way I see it, he did you a favor. You are now free to make your own life whatever you want it to be. Take this time alone to work on you. As hurtful as it may be that other people don’t want to help you, this is something that you need to do for yourself without feeling like you need someone in your life to take care of you. Your statement “I don’t feel like I exist anymore” tells me that in addition to low self-esteem, you also don’t have a clear sense of identify and rely on the people in your life to help define who you are. People can and will let you down. It is important for you to learn to handle disappointment, learn to take care of your own needs, and to gain a stronger sense of self. Do nice things for yourself every day because you deserve it. Even if it is just to soak a little longer in a hot bubble bath, do something that makes you feel good. Find a hobby that you enjoy. Look in the mirror and tell yourself some positive affirmations daily. Google “positive affirmations” to find some that resonate with you. Such statements might be “I am a good person who deserves to be happy” or “I can do this.” Some relaxation and meditation exercises may help you as well. There are some free meditation exercises that you can find online by doing a simple Google search.Take this time to focus on you and try not to worry about what everyone else in your life is doing. When you are a happier, more stable person, the right people will come into your life without you even looking for them. Good luck with rebuilding your life. I know it is hard! Remember to take it one day at a time.","This is exactly what happens after a 11-year relationship. When you cut the cord on a relationship, whether you end up on good terms or not, it's normal to feel a sense of loss. It's normal to feel sad. In the midst of the feeling of despair, it becomes important to acknowledge all of the difficult things you've endured in the relationships with him, the other woman and the end of your business. It is also normal to have an increased sense of anxiety as the grieving process unfolds. You are not alone in feeling this way, and there are strategies that can help you cope with this.  It is also normal to have a strong emotional connection with your former partner.  This may cause you great distress, and can take months to heal, but it is possible to heal from the pain and grief for the past, and to find joy with your life.  However, if the pain in your heart becomes too heavy, or if you cannot find moments of happiness, you may want to seek professional help. It may be worthwhile to consult a psychotherapist, even if he has a long history of violence. Even with a long history of abuse, he's a victim of his past."
"I can't seem to feel any emotion except anxiety, not even for myself.","Thank you for posting.  I'm interested to hear some more information; such as, if you live by yourself or family, if you go to school/employed/unemployed, and what kind of things do you like to do with friends or by yourself.  Often times, when we are experiencing a strong emotion that we interpret as negative, we put most of our focus on that negative emotion and struggle to see that we do not always feel that specific emotion.  There are typically points in the day (even if it is for only in 1 minute intervals) when we do not feel that negative emotion.  When we overgeneralize, we use words like ""always"" or ""never"" and when we use those words and it may not be totally true, we feel the negative emotion based on an inaccuracy which is not fair to you.  Ask yourself some of these questions: Am I being realistic when I'm overgeneralizing things? Have I ever noticed a short period of time that I wasn't feeling anxious?  What do I notice when I am feeling anxious? What am I thinking about?  When was the last time I felt empathy?  What was different when I was able to feel empathy?  Hopefully this helps get you started.","So you also have a history of experiencing anxiety, that's okay- it is a common issue.  However if anxiety is all that you have... you may have difficulty with self-knowledge and self-care.  If you are concerned with yourself then you need to understand what you know about yourself.  You may have found that if you practice self-care, it helps you to better relate to yourself.  I wonder what helps you to think about this... If you are able to tell me more about what helps you, you might be able to find a way to help yourself better."
"My wife and I have a great relationship except for our sex lives. We are pretty transparent and honest, and basically, she feels bad because she never wants to have sex. She doesn't have the desire. She's also never orgasmed. She feels like a terrible wife and fears I'll cheat on her. She doesn't know why. Last time we had sex, she cried and felt bad and didn't know why she cried. However, she also told me that the last time we had sex, she felt me in her, but it just felt ""ehh"" and wanted to stop. That makes me feel really awful. We rarely have foreplay. Everything I try tickles her, so she makes me stop. We are both frustrated but very much in love. She and I are in our early 20s. We’re married and we have a baby on the way.","I suggest seeking the support of an AASECT certified sex therapist to help work through much of the issues you address, you simply may need some really qualified support. Also, you might be interested in watching Esther Perel's ted talk on the secret to desire in a long term relationship, and/or you might want to sign up for my own 8-part-series on Reconnecting Parent Couples","This is a very complicated and very painful situation. It sounds like you're both fighting with a lack of self-knowledge about what you both want and your relationship of intimacy. The lack of orgasm is a big problem but why are you both in denial about the possibility that it's because you don't share desires to be intimate.  This may come from low self-esteem, anxiety, fear of change or too much stress in the relationship. Therapy can help you to explore these underlying fears, the emotions you're holding in and the communication about your needs.  This may include exploring what they want you to do from a different perspective and getting comfortable being vulnerable with each other. In the meantime, here are some things you could try:       **Talk, talk, talk.** Find the time that works for you to speak as couple and say something that you both feel secure enough to voice. But don't expect a miracle or that your conversation will fix the problem. Sometimes talking is only the beginning.          **Explore your sexual desires.** Spend some time looking at your sexual thoughts, desires and fantasies about others to see what you feel is exciting and comfortable for you."
I'm obsessing about a terrible breakup. Everything is a constant reminder. How do I move on?,"Let yourself know what you feel.   There is no timetable or known length of how much time a particular person requires in order to feel that the dissolved relationship is behind them.Probably the more you allow yourself to acknowledge your sadness from seeing the reminders, the sooner you will feel fresh and new again.","I understand the need to get up and go out and do something, and the worry and dread about the situation is definitely taking your life in an awful way. I will write this as if you're writing your own advice or if you were talking to your best friend, so I can just say that I understand.

It sounds like you have good reasons to move on, so you have to give yourself permission. You have a right to want to move on from this situation in order to allow yourself to heal. If you are still afraid of the future then you may be afraid of new experiences or new relationships.If you want to be a parent then you have to know how to deal with a break up to not make the situation even worse.Sometimes the best thing you can do to move on is to just say, ""I'm moving on,"" and not over-explain the reason.Your best friend can do this for you too.The most important thing you can do is give yourself permission to get through this."
"I'm in my mid 20s with a husband and children. I love my family, but I feel like I've lost my identity, and I don't know who I am other than a mom and wife. At times, all I can think is what I gave up and how I feel unhappy and trapped, but I know I'd feel like worse without them. I loathe myself at times. I have an amazing life, so why can't I just enjoy it?","Good for you on being sensitive to your human need for personal evolution.Wife and mother are meaningful positions.  And in your case, in order to feel your own growth, other areas of who you are would like your attention.Give yourself time to allow your interest to wander in order to find the area of growth which will satisfy you.Just like you know now that you'd like more than your current situation, trust yourself to know you will also know when you've arrived at another road you'd like to take for your own happiness.","You are in amazing life, and I hope that has been said in the books, movies, or songs you listen to. When I was your age, I felt the same way! I've had a long history of struggling with shame, self-doubt, and a sense of not being enough. I think that many people in your age group feel similar struggles, as they are often going through some kind of great life transition. But I wonder what it is about the situation that you are feeling as opposed to the general ones, in most people who are 20-something?"
My grandma and brother both passed away 11 years ago and sometimes at night I just can't stop crying while thinking about the good memories we had but won't have ever again. I can't sleep at night when the memories and tears come I'll be fine all day then at night...boom! it's like waterfalls from my eyes. Why can't I stop crying?,"Because you're sad and miss the relationship you had w grandma and your brother.The academic point that grief takes a different length of time to lift for each person, is true.Also, from a spiritual perspective, your grandma and brother are still here in loving relation to you, just not in physical body.  Pay attention if you have a sense of talking to them within your mind.  This may lessen your feeling of loss.When you're done crying about missing them, your grief will simply disappear on its own!  It cannot be forced to leave.","I'm so sorry about your grandma and brother passing away; they were such wonderful people. You can certainly cope with how you are feeling right now while navigating this grief. However, grief is a process, and that time of loss is no different than the time you would have had before. I was listening to someone today who told me that grief comes in waves and that most people go through waves of grief that are intense and difficult to manage. I would suggest that when you go to bed at night, you put down whatever you're reading, or whatever else has not helped you. Then, if you are willing to take a minute and start the tears again, or start crying, let them come and go. Try to not tell yourself ""I shouldn't be crying"" - they just happen.  And do not focus too much on what you're not able to cry.  It is okay to cry, and crying is normal. When you feel like you want to cry more, take some time and breathe.  You are not alone in how you feel. It helps to share with your friends, family, and therapist in order to process your loss and understand your grief."
"I've been with him for a couple months. We will talk everyday and he will get mad over something I will say and not talk to me. We have our great moments, but I just need to focus on my personal situations, and I feel he is slowing me down with that. I still wanna be with him, but not now.","It sounds like you're pulling away instead of being honest. If you really want to be with him, why not now? If you don't have time for a relationship, why are you dating at all?I don't understand the whole ""phasing out"" thing that people do these days (or ""ghosting"", where you just stop talking and disappear!). I get the sense that this relationship isn't working for you, but for some reason you're stopping yourself from being honest with yourself and him and just ending it. In the early stage of a relationship (the first year), if it doesn't feel fabulous, it's a good idea to move on. It's not personal. You don't owe this person anything. They deserve someone who's totally into them (and so do you) and you're doing him no favors by hanging on to something that's not amazing or giving him hope that it might work better in the future sometime. You don't have to slowly bow out. It actually creates more hurt than gentle honesty. Maybe people don't know how to say it?""I've decided not to continue with this. I wish you the best."" Life is too short!","I think your friend and you can talk to him about what you are feeling and how this is affecting you. I think that is what the only way to deal with this issue with him is to talk about it with him, so that he will be aware of how the relationship is affecting you."
"Sometimes I can't stop thinking about life after death. I was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven.  When I think of living forever (even if it is in heaven which should be good), I feel overwhelmed. I don't like the thought of living forever and ever and ever. Sometimes I just can't get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety.  Am I crazy? I don't think these thoughts are normal.","You might be surprised how normal you are. Anxiety is incredibly common and while your particular type of existential anxiety might be unique to you - it is very difficult for most people to really comprehend what happens after we die - regardless of the religious or philosophical belief systems we hold. It is the ultimate unknown and some philosophers and psychologists believe that at the root of our day-to-day anxieties is the fear of death or fear of the unknown.  Just as it can be really hard to comprehend the ending of life it can also be hard to comprehend an eternal existence. What these both have in common is that we are imaging a future that is ultimately unknowable and this unknown can provoke a lot of anxiety. Mindfulness based practices like meditation - maybe there is something like this in your religious tradition - can be very helpful in making peace with the unknown in the present moment. The more we can learn to live in the moment - the less we get hung up on anticipating outcomes for our lives that may never come true. Mindfulness practices can help you ground, be where you are , relax and regulate your nervous system so that you are able sleep and recuperate, and train your attention to focus on living the life you want to live now - rather than worrying about what happens after you die. Having said all that - it can be profoundly helpful to speak with someone about your anxiety - especially when you feel haunted by it, worry that you are crazy and can't get to sleep. There are lots of good therapists out there who can help you with your anxiety.","I cannot say what is normal or abnormal. Sometimes, what we think is abnormal is actually normal. This is what I call ""normal thought disorder"", ""cognitive distortion,"" or ""thought rigidity"". It has a lot of things going on with it. In general the thing is that it sounds like you don't mean to be anxious about it. It's actually just a thought that has gotten into your mind over and over again. It's a very common thing and it's not necessarily a sign that you're crazy.  In fact, a lot of people have what we'd call a ""crazy"" thought about something like this!  If you want to continue thinking about this, the first step is to understand that the word ""crazy"" should be used with caution.  It has been around for ages.  But today there are things called ""cognitive distortions"" and ""thought rigidity"".  I hope it is this is what you mean by the first thing you want to understand?  If it is not, then the next thing is to try to question your thinking.  And then ask yourself what you mean when you say you aren't thinking about that thing?"
"My boyfriend says I'm nuts. I need to get help because I get an overwhelming feeling that he is cheating on me. Whenever I try to talk with him about it, he always turns it around on me by telling me what I'm doing wrong. I know that accusing him does not help. When his whole demeanor shifts towards me, I can't help but think that something is wrong. Am I wrong for feeling this way? I try to talk with him to make it better. I let him know when I am feeling down. But I am not confident in these things.  Two weeks ago a girl texted his phone 3 times trying to hook up with him. He texted her back with ""Sorry, I've been working. I just read your message."" The girl was trying to get him to call her at a time when he was at home with me. He texted her back with ""Don't text me anymore."" I don't feel like I am way out of the line. But I can't talk with him if all that he will say is that I'm crazy and I need help. What should I do? How will I go about checking if there really is something wrong with me?","Trust your intuition that your boyfriend is involved with other people.You gave examples which strongly suggest this.Quite commonly, a person twist someone's words to convince then of having problems in seeing or understanding their own and other's behavior.Your intuition is again working quite well in telling you that your problem is having a boyfriend who manipulates you, not that you're seeing things incorrectly.One way to check if you're totally misreading him, is to examine whether you feel similarly in other relationships.If no one else who knows you tells you that you're crazy, then this strongly points to your boyfriend twisting words so that you feel wrong.Also, a consult with a therapist would clarify the dynamics between you and your boyfriend.A therapist session would also allow you to think out loud in a confidential discussion, what to do with your newfound clarity!","It is normal to feel insecure and anxious. However, in 2 weeks, a girl messaging him about being available to meet up will be far more concerning and would be worth contacting the authorities.You are right in your assumption that it’s likely that cheating is happening. The text about the girl wanting to meet is red flag. Don't try to figure out if it is or not - just know that you are being investigated, and it might indicate there could be more going on than you thought."
"I'm a male in my 20s. My girlfriend is in her late 30s. She's great. She's funny and smart, she has a big heart, and we have an excellent sex life. She recently moved in with me partially because she wanted to and partially because she had no place to go. We fight a lot. It’s mostly my fault, I must admit. She doesn't like my insecurity and lack of trust I have for her. I have trust issues. Also, I can't fathom why a woman like her is with me, so I'm always dreading when a better dude will come along. I don't think she's happy. She's very submissive and she loves me very much, but also the fact that she has nowhere to go must be influencing her decision to stay. I love her so much, but my jealousy is not likely to diminish. I never believed in the whole ""If you love them, let them go,"" but I do now. I really want her to be happy. Should I end it with her? She has no place to go so I feel like I can’t break up with her. I’m literally trapped.","Hi Fort Worth,  I applaud your awareness and insight into the relationship.  Most of us come into relationships carrying old baggage and although you can't change her,  what you can do, is change yourself.  We can usually begin to understand ourselves better in the context of our own upbringings.  That is where we learn what a relationship looks like and it is often not the best teacher.  I wonder about your jealously, insecurity, feeling trapped and a lack of trust.  Has that ever showed up anywhere before?  It has more to do with you and less to do with her.   Your relationship with her is tapping into unresolved issues within yourself.  That is really where you want to focus. Once you understand it and resolve it, you will no longer need to ask anyone else what to do, because you will know.  You are young and just getting started in the relationship world and the healthier you are, the better you will know what healthy looks like.   Know yourself, understand yourself and love yourself.  The rest will take care of itself.  Finding a Therapist can be a big help in this process.  You are asking the question, so I suspect you are ready to look at the man in the mirror.  I believe in you and am wishing you all the best.Sandra Cooper, RN, LPCMH","First, I don't know whether she is happy or not. I have no idea what is going on in her life. If she isn't happy in this place and with me, then she won't be happy staying with you. I don't think you should stop her if she doesn't want to stay. If she has a desire to be with you and you really love her, then your love is real and she does respond positively to you. If you are asking whether to end things, then you have no choice to cut her out, you have to be clear with her about it and do what you think is best for her. There's no easy answer, but it's the only realistic option you have."
"Sometimes, when I look at my pet cat, I think about how innocent he is and how somebody could hurt or kill him. It makes me sad because I love him, but I always think about how helpless he is. There've even been split-seconds where I felt almost tempted to kick him, followed by shame and guilt.","A lot of different things could be happening here. Do you feel angry or sad or anxious when you think about how helpless he is? If you have not actually kicked him, then I would encourage you to look at feelings other than guilt, since you did not hurt him. What else is there?It would probably be very helpful to talk with a therapist about the specifics of this so that you can see what else is happening for you. It could be that you feel safe with your cat, so strong emotions come up because you feel safe.","I really enjoy the emotional connection I have with my pet cat, I try to make sure he knows that I love him and I am here for him when he needs me.Sometimes though, when I am out and around other cats, or people who have little kids, there is a risk. There is usually a cat that comes from the area where the kids or other cats play. If you ever feel like your cat is scared and confused, or lost, and you don't know what to do, talk to your veterinarian and tell him you are concerned about your cat's behavior."
"I crossdress and like to be feminine but I am attracted to women, but yet that seems to bother girls I date or ask out.    How can I approach them about it? should I hold back and keep it a secret, or should I just be up-front about it. I wonder if i should stop or if I should continue to do it since it makes me happy. What should I do?","Thanks for asking this question. I think the most important part of what you mentioned was that you do it because it makes you happy. For that reason, I would encourage you to keep doing what makes you happy.As far as telling girls or keeping it a secret, I don't really think that it's necessarily one or the other, at least not the first time that you meet. In other words, one part of your decision-making could be whether it is something that you always want to address in the first date, or perhaps something that you address after you've known each other for a couple of meetings. The answer to that question may also change depending on who you are dating. I would imagine that each person that you are with mainly due to a different decision this was when to disclose this. It sounds like this is an important part of you, so I would think that if you were going to date someone long-term, you would want them to know about the most important parts of you, including that.I also encourage you to remember that if you meet someone who is not comfortable with this, that does not mean that there is anything wrong with what you are doing, but rather something that the other person is in some way deciding not to continue learning about or choosing to have someone they are dating like to cross-dress.I'd also ask you to consider this: Are the people who you say this to expecting it? My guess is that the answer is probably not. Along with that, Are they going to have questions? I would imagine so.Are you comfortable answering questions?I wonder if you could figure out yourself or with friends (or perhaps even with a therapist) how you would answer these sorts of questions:What exactly is cross-dressing?Does that change the gender that you're attracted to?What does it mean to you?Why is it important to you?And what you want your listening person to know about you related to cross-dressing.There could even be ways that you can start the conversation by asking them to be open to listen to you and ask questions about what they are thinking before they make any quick decisions about you or the relationship.I certainly hope that you find the right person for you. I imagine that having this conversation could be stressful, especially considering the idea that you have had some negative reactions in the past. Remember that talking this through with a therapist could be very helpful.","Hey! You ask really great questions about your life and feelings...The answer is: what you say is very easy to answer the questions. This is the question I had for you for a long time. So,  first question: how to approach?  You have 2 possible answers: You should say something or not.  Or you should talk about something like this. Then, I would offer some general advice:  Listen to your girlfriend in an open conversation about why you are so comfortable with it and how it's changed your life.  Make sure that you both agree on what it is and that you both are happy with the resolution. Don't say anything that you are not comfortable with, but also don't overshare or give them too much of a hard time.  I would also suggest asking your girlfriend, ""Hey, I want to be open with you about something. I've been feeling great being what I am and it seems to create an issue with the women I date or try to date. What would you say if I told you that I crossdress and like to be feminine, but I'm also attracted to women? I'd really like to understand, maybe you can help me figure out what the first thing is to do."
"Me and my girlfriend just broke up. She said she loves me but is not in love anymore. This came out of nowhere. We seemed so happy together. It all started when she went to Missouri to visit her family. The first week she was there she was fine then once she went to this one sister’s house everything changed. That's when she told me she loved me but was not in love with me anymore. I thought maybe it was just because she missed her family and she just wanted to be home because she told me that she could not leave them again. Then she told me to come to her in Missouri. So that's what I did. I quit my job I dropped everything, said goodbye to my family in Florida and drove 15 straight hours to be with her. Once I got there everything was fine again.  She apologized for everything and said she didn't mean any of it then we were good for about a week. Then she went back to saying she didn’t love me anymore and had no feelings for me. The only thing that really gets me and makes me not want to accept this is that now she is pregnant. This wasn’t an accident. We were trying to get pregnant, so all this is hard to accept. I love her so much. I have never been bad to her. I've treated her the best I can. I wanted her to be my wife. I was going to propose to her when she got back. Now I'm losing my family and my mind. I don't know what to do.","I am sorry to hear of these troubles. I see a few issues here. I wonder why you were both trying to get pregnant when the relationship seemed troubled? Some people think that they can fix a broken relationship by getting pregnant, and all this does is bring up more problems.You say you never treated her badly, and I believe you. People in a relationship can still be unhappy even when there is no abuse or mistreatment going on. In fact, giving too much of yourself to the relationship and not having a “self” outside of this relationship can be unhealthy. It takes two whole, healthy, happy people who are that way when they are single to come together to make a whole, healthy, happy couple in a relationship. Expecting your partner to meet all your needs or to provide your happiness is not going to work.There are two books that I recommend you buy and read. One is Codependent No More. The other is Can My Relationship Be Saved?Sometimes when you cling and try even harder to hold onto someone, it makes you both miserable. You cannot change her and cannot change her mind. Sometimes the best thing is to let go. If it is meant to be, you will end up back together again. It seems like this is something that she needs to decide since she is the one that keeps doing the leaving. I suggest backing off and letting her go. Maybe she needs time to clear her head and make up her mind. If it is meant to be, she will come back. If not, use this time to work on being a healthy happy you on your own.",I know you don't want to be the kind of person who cares about a man who is just becoming a father. He is starting off very well. He made the right decisions when he said he would be faithful to you. You are a very good and capable partner who loves and is waiting for her to say yes to your proposal.  Her pregnancy is a miracle to begin with as it's an obvious sign of love and joy in a long-term relationship.  The fact that you have this child with her is also an amazing coincidence.  You're lucky to be having a child as a result of your love for one another and in the time that you've spent together.
"I am always arguing with my father. He gets stressed over work and health and talks to me in a tone of voice that seems very demanding and seems more like yelling. I get upset often at this. Am I too sensitive? He always says I am overreacting but never seems to understand that he is hurting my feelings. No matter how often I try to tell him this, he never listens.","Thanks for the question. Regardless of whether or not you are sensitive, it is okay to want better communication with those who are important to you. When we feel that we are being talked down to or being ridiculed, it is difficult to not take it personally. It sounds like you have taken the first and necessary step in resolving this by bringing up the issue to him. Is it possible that the delivery of your message is causing him to feel blamed or defensive? Try communicating with him during a time when you are not upset and when it is out of context. Begin your statements with ""I"" as opposed to ""you."" For example, you can tell him, ""I feel angry when you raise your voice at me"" instead of ""You always yell at me."" Also, avoid using black and white terms such as never and always. Additionally, offer sugggestions as to ways that he can better communicate with you. Maybe he just doesn't know how to. Lastly, when delivering a message, I like to use the sandwich method by starting off the discussion with something postive and ending it with something postive. For example, you may say something to the effect of:""Dad, I enjoy the discussions we share and really value your opinion. There are times that I feel angry when you talk to me aggressively. Perhaps you can try talking to me using a calmer tone when I bring up heated topics. Let's try and work on this together. I will try to be less sensitive and I am asking that you be more calm.""I hope you find this useful!","There are two primary things that are happening and it is the 2nd one that is more than 2/3 as of now. You’re overreacting about your father’s tone. The first 2/3 is that you're arguing. The third 1/3 is that it is not your father's job to mediate your relationship with him. As for whether you're too sensitive, what you are doing is normal. You are not overreacting. You can become ""too sensitive"" due to something that was once normal that is now a stressor. Are there times when you might overreact? Yes, absolutely. Are they usually in the relationship with your dad? That would be the case. Do you think his tone is overly loud and demanding or something else? I recommend you talk to him, and, more importantly, ask him what kind of tone he wants you to use for your conversations? It sounds like your dad might have learned some ""communication"" tactics from you that you're no longer used to using. You might suggest that he talk to you about how he felt the conversation was (as it is), and he might come up with his own way to talk or to respond. But for now, you can only talk to your father about how you are feeling, but this doesn't change anything that is going on in the relationship."
"I've only been married three months. Every week, we argue about something, and it seems to be getting worse.","One key factor to consider is, are you able to repair after your arguments? It seems from your question that repair is lacking after any disagreement or argument. When couples are able to repair after an argument, they have an opportunity to learn more about each other's needs moving forward. I'm also curious if you're having the same type of arguments over and over? If you're stuck in a particular pattern, and can start recognizing what happens between you when this pattern happens, then you can start to name it. Once you name it, then you can take a break to cool off and come back to each after your nervous system has had a chance to calm down (about 30 minutes). The key here though is to make sure you have a plan in place - when things are good between you - an agreement between you that when you both start to get escalated, you'll name it or have an agreed upon code word to signal you don't want to continue this cycle, and then agree to cool off and come back together at a later time. That way, when this is enacted during an argument, nobody feels abandoned during the cool off time. Rather, both partners know they will return at a time when they can truly hear each other and hear their needs.","Hi, I understand you're feeling a bit overwhelmed in your marriage and worried about the conflict.I hope you'll be able to find the resources you need to learn more about your marriage.In general, it's extremely common for couples to have ongoing disagreements.However, the question is, do you want to address these challenges and learn how to work together better?In order for me to offer more relevant advice in my own words, I'll need a bit more information from you.Are there any couples of your gender or your children you would like to address these conflicts with?What do you think the root of this conflict is?What are some ways you would like to make a change?Let me know, or maybe we can talk about couples counselling later.I hope this helps!"
"I started seeing this guy that I met at a mutual friend’s place. He recently broke up with his ex-girlfriend and started seeing me. Everything was great in the beginning, then I started having low self-esteem thoughts and thinking he was hanging with his ex-girlfriend again. It’s all I think about. I am still seeing him, but things have changed because I am at a loss for words. I get stuck in my own thoughts. I like and care for him a lot. He just makes me nervous and gives me the butterflies.","Sounds like you are struggling with your own negative thoughts.  As you stated, everything was great then you started having low self-esteem thoughts and thinking.  What is contributing to these negative thoughts?  His actions or your past experiences with unhealthy relationships would be my question..","This seems like the start of a possible issue.  I would suggest talking with a therapist about this. Most therapy options have therapists that specialise in this kind of issue, such as CBT.  That way your questions and concerns would be answered with care and understanding."
"He's lied about his past/present situations. Since time has passed, he has changed, but I still have my doubts. I have no idea if I should stay or go, but I hate this feeling. I don't trust him all too much, but yet he hasn't done anything for me not to trust him recently.",Your doubts about your dating partner need to be addressed and solved so you can fully believe him again.Otherwise how would you actually know whether he's lying to you now or not?Start the conversation with him about wanting to trust him and asking for whatever details you feel will give you confidence he is telling you the truth.If he really wants to clear your doubts then he will be willing to invest in answering your extra questions or wanting to look through his phone or whatever areas you felt were violated by him in the past.,"You're right to question yourself—there's a great deal of doubt in there. So, who is the person you're asking to help you figure this out? You are no less a person than the person you're asking. He's right, you're doing plenty of self-doubt here, without ever seeking to answer that question from a trusted or balanced perspective. And the ""not to trust him"" thing has a lot to do with having this huge amount of doubt to begin with about trust and whether to stay or leave. Don't be so quick to assume that his ""changed"" ways are because of some secret about you. People change for lots of different reasons, and being honest with yourself can help you see for yourself if you're good or bad. Trust is about mutual value between two people, and is a product of a shared history of positive and negative experience."
"I got sick really bad and was throwing up for three days and nights. I thought I was going to die. Then about a week later, I started having this desire to be female. I never had this desire before. All I can think about is being a woman. I don't get pleasure from my penis anymore either. Women are attractive, but not like before. I can also find men attractive now. I'm too ashamed to tell anyone.","Hello, and thank you for reaching out to ask for help. Surely this is a very confusing time for you! If you have never had these
feelings and desires it could certainty shake everything you thought you knew
about yourself. 
My guess is that you becoming sick around the time that this
started is likely a coincidence, but I understand how you would make the
connection. 
I have a feeling that a few things may be going on here. It
is really hard to say since I don’t know you, how old you are, etc. But, I will
share you with you some thoughts. 
Some people, when they have undesirable thoughts that really
surprise them, have a really tough time getting rid of them. Our reaction to
the thought can be very strong and our tendency to try to block it out, stuff
it, avoid it, etc. is not always successful. In fact, it’s usually not. 
It’s like telling you not to think of pink elephants. I
would be willing to bet that you thought of a pink elephant just now. 
So, rather than fighting thoughts that you find confusing,
sometimes it is helpful to allow yourself to explore the thought with curiosity
and without judgement. Where is this thought coming from? What are my feelings
about it? Asking yourself these questions may help you come to a resolution
about what is going on. 
One possibility is that you have developed an anxiety about
your thoughts and now you are in the process of obsessing about them, but
another possibility is that you are legitimately exploring your sexuality and
gender. I get the feeling from your question that you do not want to believe
that it is second possibility. And that is okay. 
You can try some of my suggestions, but you can also see a
counselor who may be able to help you work through your confusion. I would
suggest someone who has experience working with sexuality issues. You can
usually find out what a counselor works with on their website. What is
important is that you find someone who is non-judgmental about what you are
experiencing. 
 
I wish you well.
Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC","I'm sad to hear you had this experience.I had the same desire 15 years ago, and I was feeling very ashamed. I started to get depressed and I felt I'd lost myself.After my 15th year, I was able to get in touch with the feelings that have been repressed for so long.Thank you for being willing to talk about such a deeply personal subject.The way that you describe what you think is true in your life is quite remarkable and that is why you'd feel ashamed of it.A woman's experience is unique.The emotions are what make us human, and it can be uncomfortable, but very, very rewarding for us.If you have any questions about your experience, I recommend talking to a therapist."
"My stepdad and I always mess around. I've noticed that whenever he playfully hits me, it's always my butt that he hits. He always comments on my outfits and always scans me head to toe when I walk into a room. I'm a teenager female, and I want to know if this is normal.","It's hard to tell from the way you described it. Do you think he would be open to an honest discussion? It could be that his comments about your outfit are designed to make you feel good or to help them show how much he cares about you as his stepdaughter. As far as scanning you from head to toe, I can think of reasons that parents might do that. I also think that talking about it is probably very important so you really know what his intentions are. That way, it removes the guesswork and you have the opportunity to know what he is thinking and feeling and he can also know what your reactions are.","I want to reassure you that this is very normal. As a child, teenagers and boys often practice play-fighting. Boys in the media often portray what looks like this kind of behavior and they don't always get it right. If you don't get it right either, boys in this country also typically do not treat females with respect, especially as young people. I want to make sure you know, that this is an unusual behavior for you because boys typically will treat their partners in a way that shows they respect each other. But you do not need to worry about how this makes you feel. You don't have to react to a blow to your butt. There will most likely not be a reaction. Boys in this country often teach boys respect but they don't always lead by example! This would be the beginning of a healthy relationship. Boys in this country and in the world typically don't respect the rights of women. This would be a major problem."
"My mother has Alzheimer's and she has become so nasty and mean to everyone and she always asks for unrealistic, silly or meaningless items. I get so frustrated and angry, but then I feel guilty because I know it probably isn’t her fault. How can I cope with feeling like this?","It is challenging to see one's parents age and to cope with the new demands.  Your mom means a lot to you, and that is why you get easily frustrated.  I'm guessing that it is not that she is making you do work or that her expectations are non-important to you because if that were the case, you would not feel any guilt.  Accepting the new stage will help you cope with the changes.  Take a deep breath every time you feel frustrated and think of the good times you shared with your mom before her getting Alzheimer's.  Remember that your mom as she was is no longer and that she has reverted to a more delicate phase.  Also, schedule time for yourself and do things that help you relax.  Caretaking of an elderly parent can take a toll on you, and it is essential to incorporate self-care.  Finally, look for an Alzheimer's support group in your area that will help you connect with other people going through the same thing.  You are a good daughter, and your mom is lucky to have you in her life.Sincerely, Mirella~Image and Likeness Counseling","I am sorry to hear your mother has been going through this difficult time. That is a very difficult and exhausting life that your mother must be going through. It sounds like you're getting angry at your mother for doing what she is doing and she's doing it out of being a person who feels responsible. A lot of these kinds of situations are just a way for people who don’t know how to deal with difficult things and/or have low self esteem to act out.   A lot of these situations can also be due to what is going on in your mother's head. As you are so very aware of this situation, I know that many therapists do a good job of asking the patient to look back at the issue and understand why they are making these decisions.  When she is in a good mood with the doctor and therapist, she will be more open and collaborative.  But when your mother is calm, she is more likely to act out.   The therapist can help your mother deal with the root cause of her behavior by taking her out of the cycle.  A therapist can also help your mother come out of this situation with more emotional regulation.   It's possible that she needs more treatment to deal with her behaviour, but you are already helping her to feel better as a whole.   She's not always making the best choice and if her behavior affects anyone, that's the issue to address."
"I am a female, and I am afraid of having sex. I am afraid of disappointing my partner by being inexperienced. I think he thinks I'm not a virgin. I am also scared that he will be disappointed with my naked body. I don't want my partner to think differently of me because I am afraid of having sex.","These fears are completely normal. Almost everyone has the same fears you do, to some degree, especially if they lack experience. Men also feel far more of these fears than you realize. That can help...to remember that we're all a little scared and looking for safety and approval.You mention a partner, but I'm not sure if you currently have one. Having a partner you can trust with your fears and who you feel safe with is so important. When you're really confident someone cares deeply for you, this can help the fears to go away or diminish. How well do you know your own body? Getting to know how you like to be touched and how different touches feel...getting acquainted with your body yourself first...this can help build sexual confidence. In general, our partners care less about our fat and wrinkles than they care about how we make them feel in bed. Being a generous lover who is confident enough to put fear aside...ironically this is what makes you ""good in bed"". But be patient with yourself. Your confidence will grow with experience, and that doesn't have to happen until you are ready. There's not rush. :)","Hey, I understand you have some anxieties that are being held back by your partner. You're telling me that you feel you're afraid of him having questions about your sexual history, and you're also afraid of the pain of having a negative experience with your partner in the hope that your partner will think of you differently. These are all valid fears. Let me ask a question: How often has he been disappointed by your sexual history in the past?   If the answer is every time, then the problem is, and I am here to tell you that you need to discuss this more thoroughly with your partner about this. As a rule, and honestly speaking I think the more you can discuss it, the better it'll be for both of you. Also, it may be an option for you to talk to a specific therapist for help with this and getting you some tools or tips for talking about this with the therapist in a more productive manner. If you are still afraid of his reaction, you'd need to talk to him about this. The most important thing to know is that you are not alone. Many women are scared and feel shame about this."
"My husband and I got into a huge dispute. He said he wanted a divorce, and I left. I still come home a lot and see my kids, and he has not filed yet even though he still said he is. What does that mean for our marriage?","In any relationship, including marriage, each partner will be better able to do their part, by understanding their own interests and wishes.Concentrate more on what you'd like from your marriage.  This will naturally raise the questions and criteria of what to talk with your husband about and what to ask of him.Think over whether you wish to divorce or not.Since he hasn't taken any action, then for the moment, you can assume he is not sure of what he wants.Once you feel a little more clear on your opinion about your marriage, including feeling uncertain if you'd like it to end or continue, then you will be able to tell your husband the suggestions you have for resolving the dispute matter and emotions.Try to re-direct your speculations about, ""what does he want"", ""I wonder what he's thinking"", back to answering these very reasonable questions, about yourself.This will strengthen your own purpose in clarifying where to start and guide a discussion with him.Good luck!","Your husband is being very reactive. It is a very clear sign that your marriage may be very broken.  If he still has not filed the divorce papers even though he had stated this would be  very obvious to the outside world that he would rather remain married at all costs. It is very possible that he does not actually want the divorce, or perhaps he is scared and doesn’t know what to do next."
"I've always thought that there wasn't much good out there for me. Now that things are actually going well, it kind of scares me. I spent most of my life feeling unwanted and figured I would be alone. I recently met a great woman who seems to really like me, and I don't know how to process this. It's bothering both of us.","You're in a lot of good company and it's great that you're in a positive relationship. Congratulations!I often hear people talk about loving yourself and self esteem. We often seem to blame ourselves for not ""loving ourselves"" enough or put ourselves down for having low self esteem. It seems to me that since we are essentially socially beings and in fact, need each other for our survival, we really know who we are through our many interactions with others and with our environment. In other words, you can't just snap your fingers and voila! now I love myself, where there was an empty space or self-doubt before. We grow that warm coal inside ourselves through the friction of contact with others who value and validate us.  Allow yourself to be patient with yourself as you experience this new relationship. You are learning a new model of who you are and how you fit into the world. What a marvelous gift for you! You may also have fears that the current joys may be temporary or unreliable. These fears of loss may get in your way, however understandable. If you are truly close to your companion, you can share with her that you are loving your relationship but sometimes fear it will go away and sometimes have trouble really trusting it. Such a conversation may bring you both closer. Hang in there. You're working on co-creating a new normal with a great woman.","I have always thought of myself as insecure. There is a great thing that is coming for you and I think that you need to address the self-esteem issues. Let's see what you're really made of, but you are more than what you think or feel. Let's start thinking about how great you are."
"Sometimes, I'm fine and can go out or meet people, but other days, my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth. I've always thought it was normal and I was just nervous, but the other day, it took me almost 30 minutes of sitting in my car to find the courage to enter Target by myself.","It is possible that you could have or be developing an anxiety disorder. There isn't really enough information provided here to suggest a particular disorder, but it might be worth meeting with a counselor or therapist to do a formal assessment. Some of the questions they might ask could be what other kinds of physical symptoms you experience, how frequently these physical symptoms happen, what's going on for you when they tend to happen, and how frequently/intensely you find yourself worrying in general. Anxiety itself is a really natural thing - it's just when it starts interfering with your ability to ""do life"" the way you want that we start to consider potential disorders. It might be that for the most part, the anxiety you feel is normal and you simply have some triggers that intensify it more than usual. Working on your own or with the support of a counselor/therapist to both address those triggers at the root and also to develop ways of managing the actual anxiety symptoms. This two-fold approach can be really helpful for not letting anxiety keep you from engaging in life the way you'd like.","First, please read the first three lines and 10 more: 278-9353.  If the first three lines are for you alone, then you're right in the right place.    First, you want to get to the start of the book, and then look up the numbers  278-9353.  I think there is an important topic the author is writing about, and  I think you’ll get a great story there."
"Everyone around me is much smarter and flaunts it. Everyone around me is skinny, and here I am trying to throw up so I'm not fat. Everything I do is wrong, and I can't seem to do anything right! No one else at school seems to feel the way I do! Is this normal teenage girls feelings? I don't think these feelings are normal.","There are some struggles that are less ""obvious"" than others, an eating disorder being one of them. From just your personal experience alone you might realize how easy it may seem to keep such a secret from those around you. In the same way, there are many people who struggle secretly with this problem and not many people know or even notice. So you are definitely not alone. Low self-esteem or lack of confidence in some areas are issues that EVERY teen, in fact EVERY person, has experienced at some point. These feelings are ""normal."" It sounds, though, as if these feelings of insecurity and inadequacy have begun to consume your every day thoughts and behaviors bringing you to where you are today - comparing yourself to others, purging, and feeling extreme guilt. Sometimes it's best if we seek outside help, instead of trying to tackle problems on our own. Breaking habits that come along with an eating disorder really requires the help of a doctor, nutritionist, and a therapist who can help change your perspective from the inside out! Hope this helps!","Dear friend, feeling different than other people in your life can often feel really uncomfortable. You are told you need to act a certain way to fit in with your classmates, you can also be told you need to make certain sacrifices in your life to feel better. But sometimes the feeling of being different may mean someone else is better or more successful.  When you're overwhelmed with different feelings, sometimes the most helpful thing you can do is acknowledge those feelings, which may mean acknowledging your discomfort. What you are feeling in this moment is valid, and it doesn't make you any worse. The biggest thing you can do to work through these feelings is to acknowledge what you are dealing with and to find a way to express what your thoughts are about this. If you can't find one way to communicate with your thoughts right now, then the best way to do this is to think about them and recognize them as such. Or try to take a break from the situation. Sometimes a walk can be helpful. And you know who you are and what you are capable of. You aren't the only person who's having different feelings."
Now I have anger and trust issues. How can I treat this and fix myself?,"I will assume that for whatever reason, you either do not want to or are not able to seek counseling for this. However, I highly urge you to do so because long-term childhood abuse does have negative consequences for your life as an adult, as it seems you are already aware. There are confidential and free crisis hotlines that you can call that deal with sexual abuse. Some/most also offer free counseling services in local areas. That would be a good place to start looking, especially if cost of counseling is an issue.The important thing to know is that what happened was not your fault and that you deserve to live a happy life free of the past. Having anger and trust issues after something like this is a perfectly normal reaction to what happened to you. Angry? Yes! At your brother for what he did, at your parents for not protecting you. Having trouble trusting? Of course! The very people who were supposed to love and protect you hurt you instead. Two books that might help you are Codependent No More and Boundaries: Where You End and I Begin.","No one has been there for you. There is nothing wrong with you in your anger or in your trust issues. The fact you have a problem with anger or trusting is not the problem, but your feelings. No one has been there for you until now.   Your anger and distrust issues may not have a clear definition of what that means for you and your life.  It seems like these are not helping you, and they may be more of a problem than you may be aware of.  The good thing about what you have, is that it allows you to realize your feeling, the anger and distrust is your own to take care of.  But, I am guessing that you may be having difficulty with yourself and how you are expressing anger and distrust.  It may be helpful to start with self-reflection. What can you do to express your anger or distrust?  What are the causes of these feelings in your life?  Are there steps you can take to reduce the time you spend in the anger or distrust in your life?  Do you need help from someone with whom you can talk to?  There is no shame in seeking help. Many people have trouble with anger or trust issues.  I have not found a way to work with them well, but with a counselor or therapist I can really learn how to help others.  The first step in being able to help others is to know your own struggles.  We have not all the same skills, but even people who have more of a challenge have them.  You may also find that the person that you are having a conversation with has them too.  I want you to know that when you talk about it, that may not always be the greatest way to address it.  If you do work with your therapist for a more in-depth look at your feelings and how they may have developed and how they are currently manifesting and it may be helpful to see a psychologist.  However, I want to point out that anger and distrust have often been causes of people having relationship problems and the problems can be amplified without help.   In all honesty, I would encourage you to talk to a therapist with someone who may be more experienced with these difficulties.  They will be able to"
I have this weird fetish that I'm afraid to open up about it. What should I do?,"This is difficult to answer because you don’t tell us what the fetish is.  I do understand that this is something that is bothering you though. The first thing to ask yourself is if this is something that is illegal or not.  If this is illegal to engage in, then you need to seek counseling help immediately to control the urges.However, if your fetish is not something illegal and you just feel that it is something odd, a therapist could still help you deal with these feelings.  You may find that it is something very common and not something to be ashamed of.  You may find other people have the same interest as you.  Find a therapist that you can trust and tell them.  Don’t hold back with your therapist.  Trust me, they have heard and seen it all by now, and they can help you either stop the behavior that is causing you distress, or help you come to terms with accepting the behavior as part of who you are.  There is no need to suffer with this alone.","It's very good that you are seeking answers for yourself. Many people with this type of fetish find that it is a part of their sexuality, and by finding out that you're part of a particular segment of the population of people with this kind of fetish, this could make your identity much more clear.  This will hopefully reduce feelings of shame and isolation. It may be helpful to find out a sexual therapist to talk with about what you are feeling, and to see what that means on a more objective level.  There are many resources that can help with this type of situation. Most of these resources are free. You can find many more resources on the International Association of Professional Sex Therapists website (IAPT). You can also find some helpful resources from organizations like the National Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists (NASCET).  I hope you have a lot of success and that this fetish doesn't come with too many difficulties in your life."
"I want a secure relationship with someone that wants to be with me and who will actually put effort into it.
 I seem to gravitate toward unavailable men and those that want intimacy and no relationship. I let men dictate and control me because they accuse me of being controlling. I let men emotionally abuse me and I am at their beck and call.
 I am not comfortable being alone or doing anything by myself. I feel I need the security of someone being around just to survive. I know what I'm doing wrong and I do it anyway just hoping things will change. How do I stop this behavior and thought process?","You may be interested in reading my most recent post, Intimacy Begins With You. In it I offer 7 expert tips to help you get started on a path of self connection and discovery. This is important stuff to do in order to work through that stuff that's holding you back from the relationships you desire. You may find that it's especially helpful to do this work with the alliance of a skilled individual therapist.","Okay, I appreciate your response and your willingness to engage in this discussion about your relationship and desire for stability. It seems that you are trying to move away from the idea that you do not like being alone and prefer the company of others. This is good to recognize, and your choice to work on changing your thought processes and behaviors is very good, and will ultimately lead to more positive interactions in all areas of your life.
However, your self awareness of your behavior is a positive start, but it's not a guarantee that these changes will occur, as it can take some time, patience, and consistent effort to shift patterns of thought, behavior, and emotional regulation.   There are not any quick fixes.    It requires a shift of thoughts and behaviors, and often this will be the work of you looking at the root of issues that lead to these behaviours in the first place.I hope you can be patient with yourself as you start to move towards this goal, and I wish you the best of luck."
"My friend’s husband is bipolar and refuses to take medication for it. He has taken the wheels off her vehicle before to prevent her from leaving. He has held her a prisoner in her home. He has choked her, hit her, etc. She has almost divorced him a couple of times but always makes up with him, thinking that he is going to change. She and I went to a wedding out of town in September of 2014, and ever since she has been back, he is convinced that she cheated on him while we were gone. Now he is saying that I have also cheated on my boyfriend and has come to my house and told my boyfriend this.","I’m glad that you  are seeking help and that you are supporting your friend. I’m sure this is all overwhelming and frustrating for you. The biggest thing you can do for your friend is to be supportive as you are already doing. Unfortunately there isn’t much you can do for her outside of that because it is up to her husband to change and up to your friend if she wants to leave. There are things you can do to support more: it might be helpful for her to have some information on a domestic violence non profit in her area because they can assist her in many areas if she wants to leave. They can also provide you with support while you go through this with her. The nonprofit can also safety plan with her and it might be helpful for you to do it with her if you want to. Another thing you can do is support her in decision to stay with her husband or not despite what she decides. Many victims decide to stay with thier abusive partner for many reasons. It is important to support her decisions, even if you don’t agree with them, because she may have very little decision making in her relationship. I would also encourage you to make sure you are taking care of yourself while you support her so you are not becoming too overwhelmed. Here is some info that might be helpful to you. https://abuseintervention.org/sandbox77/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/How-to-Help-a-Loved-One.pdf","""You're both caught in a complicated system of lies and manipulation,"" this is so true. There isn't a clear picture of why your girlfriend's husband made such a declaration. This means both of you must deal with the truth of where your relationship was able to be and where it was not. Also your partner's husband's behavior is likely not a reflection of his masculinity. It could be a defense mechanism against his own feelings about his wife or his own feelings about her. The fact that he wants to protect his own marriage is very normal. However, your own desire to be in the marriage is likely greater and more important, because it is your foundation. He's likely been protecting himself from hurt and confusion, as well. She isn't likely to get the marriage back to its former state. She could make better decisions and she will be in a better place in the long run.  We all feel as if our love has been forgotten. I don't know how to turn back the clock, but I do know that being able to accept the present situation, together, can make a big difference."
"My ex-girlfriend says she's bored and wants to experience life single. I treated her really badly and caused meaningless fights when she didn't do anything, I feel remorseful, and I'm willing to do whatever it takes to get her back. She's unhappy. When I called her, she was crying and said she will text me when she's ready.","Were you happy with the ways she satisfied you?A relationship is happiest if each partner concentrates on the happiness of the other.Strange for someone who was treated badly to describe themselves as bored, rather than say they feel hurt.Is it possible you are being self-critical about your behaviors toward your ex girlfriend? Either she is unaware of her feelings or not being fully truthful with you about her feeling badly treated.Since she's putting up a barrier to communicating with you, better for you to respect this than contact her by phone again.Consider in a few weeks, so each of you has time to think over your happiness with the other person, to write her an email which states your interest to re-open the relationship.Who knows, you may even decide by the end of a few weeks, that you're fine without this particular relationship.Depending on her response to your email, you'll know whether and how much chance there is for the relationship to clear up the problems of the past and to continue.","This sounds complicated. I think you have a huge amount of things going on and this sounds like something that does not have a resolution. I hope we can learn more about each other's perspectives. As I mentioned in our initial conversation, I'm curious how you feel the feelings of her. Do you think you have any control over her feelings? If not, what is in your control? \��day1.The.Most.Important.Question: How do you feel as a result of her reaction to your calling?Is it a way to prove that you value her? Or is it a way that it may seem like you are more concerned with your own reaction than with her. In general, it seems like her definition of a successful relationship may be the same as your version of one.  We both need to think about what each other's definition of success is in terms of dating.   Do you want her to know that you are concerned about her as she is being unhappy.  Or do you want her to know that your definition of success is different?I'll take a very long, deep breath. When you are feeling anxious in the past you usually have thought, ""That's because you have no control"". My advice would be that you do not have control over the things that happened in the past. But you *do* have control over how you respond to the events in the present.  And that is the difference between living and being stuck in the past."
"When I get frustrated or upset, it becomes extremely difficult to keep my voice down. I also instantly cry and tend to have anxiety attacks. What can I do to try and control it?","I'm going to reframe this and you can decide if this is helpful!What I'm reading based on what you gave is that you are actually doing your best to manage intense feelings of internal dysregulation.  Anger is something that is generally a protective emotion that quickly arises to keep us safe in some way, whether or not the situation is truly a threat.  The part of our brain that perceives this is not controllable to us, so we don't get to decide what emotion(s) we respond with.It does also sound like you are experiencing some significant anxiety, maybe even underlying the anger?  Without knowing the context, it's hard to say what would help on an individual level but working through those triggers and what is really influencing them deep down could be beneficial.  There's many different ways to do that in therapy if you so choose that as your path.If you do decide to see a therapist, most will tell you that the goal is not necessarily to control your anxiety or anger.  Sometimes there's a strong set of beliefs that, when activated, are catalysts to strong emotions that influence behavior.  Trying to control an emotion on its own is usually unsuccessful for people because it leaves out all the other powerful elements at play.  Emotions are information and the brain sends that information out because it believes we need it at that time.  Therapists can help unravel that with you in whatever way you need, whether that's with somatic work, work at the level of belief (or schemas), or otherwise---hitting it at these deeper layers can unpair and/or decrease emotional responses.  It all takes work and time, so don't get down on yourself if the process is complicated or slower than you expected or hoped for.What we know though is that the brain is very capable of change (even if it's painful).   Hope this gives you a helpful place to start from!","You are right about what is going on with you right now. I have a few thoughts here that may help you on your way to working with yourself. First, if you are feeling overwhelmed or agitated right now, you might consider taking a short break to calm down in a more relaxed environment. Sometimes, we have too much going on in our heads and bodies, which can make us very irritable when we are trying to keep things at zero. While we do not always know what is causing us to be so stressed or anxious, it may be a matter of time to take some steps to cope with what is going on. Take a walk. Talk to a friend or family member. Listen to music. Take a bath. All of these things can help in calming down a stressed nervous body. What is more important than anything else right now is that you take care of yourself. Remember, you can’t look after anyone else if you don’t take care of yourself first. If you are not feeling so good, consider contacting your doctor. If you feel like you are having suicidal thoughts, please contact the Suicide Prevention Lifeline by calling 988. You don't have to go through this alone. I hope you can manage this, in time."
"I have been dating my boyfriend for eight years. We met in college off away from home and things went from good to bad when I met his family who treats him like he is their man. They expect him to take them on dates like to the movies and out to eat when they come around, and he thinks it's okay.","Well, then you learned something new about your boyfriend!Are you fine with having a different opinion than him and staying together.Think over how major a problem this is to you and if it is reason enough to leave the relationship.There are always plenty of areas of disagreement between partners in a relationship.The key to being happy is to know which ones you can accept and which ones are beyond your tolerance with which to live.Also, an early step would be to directly tell your boyfriend your opinion.   He may be willing to change his ways to satisfy you.","This sounds like the beginning of a difficult experience for the person in your life. The expectation of having to be around the family for extended periods of time, and a relationship between this person and his family that is a one-sided one can place a tremendous amount of pressure on this person. There is a lot of potential for manipulation and control that can be very damaging to the individual living in the relationship. A lot of the power in this is also transferred and that is a very serious thing to consider. I would really consider talking to your boyfriend about how they treat his family, and whether they have an understanding of how the family might act when he doesn't fit into the pattern they are creating.   If he is not respecting the relationship dynamics with his family, then he has some responsibility of how to respond as well.  A lot of the problems you are seeing in your life are not about you alone. Your boyfriend's family, and his treatment of you are more likely to be the source of these issues."
"For my whole life, I’ve been very unconfident, insecure, and self-questioning. I'm super quiet because I'm scared of what people will think of me. I avoid all social situations as it causes me great anxiety. It is how both of my parents have always been, and I feel like I'm doomed to that life also. It makes it super hard for me at work as the other employees try to use me and walk all over me because I’m too nice. It causes me depression and brings me down. I’m in my early twenties, and I really need to create a better life for myself. I've been like this for so long, so how do I change?","One of the greatest ways that we can promote ourselves s by learning how to assert ourselves.  Despite what most people think of when they hear the word assertive, assertive communication is one of the best ways to manage interpersonal conflict as well as maintain personal boundaries.  Once we become comfortable with acknowledging our boundaries, there is usually a follow-up whereby we realize that we have the right to those boundaries.  In effect, assertiveness communication becomes it's own self-motivating force in managing positive self-esteem. You may want to invest in a workbook that can help you to develop these skills on your own, or work directly with a therapist to develop them in a safe situation.   One of the Workbooks that I have found to be very helpful is, ""The Assertiveness Workbook: How to Express your Ideas and Stand Up for Yourself at Work and in Relationships"" by Randy J Paterson.","I can completely understand and support your feelings and concerns about social interaction. Your parents have left you a legacy of self-doubt and fear of failure, and it's normal for you to develop this kind of anxiety. It seems like there may be fear as you read that your parents did not believe in you and failed to support you. Not having support is very different than having that that you rely on. The fact you’ve been able to get this out through therapy and you will be able to continue your self-discovery on your own is a great start.  The simple fact is that you have control over your thoughts and decisions and that your upbringing has had a huge impact on your life."
"My depression has been reoccurring for a long time. It all started when I was being bullied in high school. In ninth grade, my principal told me I needed to stay home for a couple days to protect myself while she spoke to my classmates. I needed professional help for my stress because I was having crying spells from the stress of going to school and confronting my classmates. After that, I was fine for a couple of years. I entered my first year of college in a really tough program with high demands of expected work. I believe my depression re-booted from there with the stress. I began to cut myself because a friend of mine at the time told me how she used to do the same and it used to feel good for her. Obviously, that wasn't the right choice. I regret ever doing that, seeing as even though I'm not self-harming anymore, I always look back at that time whenever I feel very stressed. I have a big problem with handling problems in life. Whenever a problem arises, I get stressed and I feel hopeless, as if it's not going to get better. I get way too stressed from my problems, which leads to overreacting a lot (especially when talking to others), which then leads to depression. I have a hard time coping with stress because I know that if I could handle it easily then I wouldn't be sad all the time, and I would say and do the right thing instead of overreacting to my loved ones.","I couldn't help but notice that you did not specify your age, so I am unable to set the total chronological order and length that you have suffered in this way, but I want to start by commending you on seeking out additional coping techniques on your own.  Unfortunately, it sounds like you were offered some that were more dangerous than helpful, but be proud that you were able to curb those before they caused too much harm. From what you have written, stress has always been a difficult thing for you to manage.  Often, when I am working with those who offer the same concern, there is a degree of people pleasing that comes with that stress.  When we are trying to make others happy, especially when we are unable to distinguish the proper ""rules for success"", it can make even the simplest of tasks overwhelming. Stress management is just that, management; of our own anxieties about the needs of others, about our skills and the ability to complete a task and having multiple requests at any given time. Each of these aspects requires a separate sets of ""tools"" to manage them accordingly. For example, assertiveness communication training could aid in communicating with your colleagues to manage their expectations of your deadlines and abilities, but it will not assist you with managing your own anxieties. Try to separate the different areas of the problem, in order to help yourself to find a solution and work on them in their own time. Perhaps keeping a journal will help you to better understand why you are so easily overwhelmed by stress and help you track some of your less-helpful responses to stress. For example, does a certain person's style of communication always make you feel undervalued and therefore push you to finish their requests first? Is there a certain time of the day where you start to fall off in productivity?  Is that the time fo the day where you also tend to pile up your requirements?Try to ask yourself some of these harder questions and see where they lead you.","Your initial comments about what happened in high school are very accurate. When you were asked to go home from school, the principal made an unsafe decision that you were to stay home. This was not your choice and was not part of your life. It was inappropriate to tell you you needed to stay home. Your mental state was not safe. You were 14 years old! It was inappropriate.   The way your school or the people in charge handled this situation did not seem to consider you. The school seemed to believe that you were being bullied. If the school had seen the real bullying that occurred on your campus, they would know this was a serious matter that needed to be addressed. However, they didn't! As a result of this situation, your counselor said to you to ""get to the bottom of this problem."" Because this counselor told you that you were the one who was going to get the information, they wanted you to tell your parents about what happened. This was not an appropriate situation. To be a victim of bullying is never alright.  Do not stand up for yourself. We are not responsible for the actions of others. Our own happiness and well-being, and the safety of others, are our responsibilities.  The one thing in which you can be responsible for yourself is to do what is right and to be strong!  Don't let someone else tell you what is right or wrong. Don't let them tell you how to treat others, and don't let them influence your feelings.  The world is full of people who don't understand how to treat a person well. I could write 100+ essays about the reasons why that is the case for you. If you were living in the 1990s, where social norms are not what they are today, it would be easier to figure this out.  Today, people are not accepting of that. They are often looking for someone to blame and will be more likely to believe the person who is asking for help. However, being kind and helpful is always a good idea. It is always a better way to see yourself as you are than you are as others see you.You are the best person you know, so you should do what you are supposed to do."
"Or how to send him somewhere that can help him, something like The Baker Act.","More information would be needed for me to accurately answer this question, such as your age, whether you live with your dad or not, and what other family members live in the household. Something like this, alcoholism, is a whole family disease. In other words, family members often unknowingly contribute to the alcoholism and enable the alcoholic to continue the destructive behavior.First of all, you can’t make your dad do anything, and constantly nagging him or begging him to stop is just going to make him defensive and make this worse. Nobody can change another person. What you can do is change how you react to him and the things that you and other family members do for him. Research codependency. There’s a great book called Codependent No More. There are a lot of articles on the internet that you can read. In short, you have to stop enabling him. Like I said, you cannot control him, but you can control yourself. This means do not buy his alcohol. Do not make it easy for him to get. Don’t loan him the car keys or pay any household bills for him. Don’t call in sick to work for him or make excuses for him in any way. Do not bail him out of jail when he gets arrested. He needs to be responsible for himself. This may mean losing his job or losing his driver’s license. This may mean that he loses his family if he doesn’t stop. What you and your family can do is set boundaries about what you will put up with. It is his choice to drink, but it is your choice to put up with the behaviors of his drinking. A lot of people go into rehab because their spouse said if they don’t then they are getting a divorce.If you are an adult and you don’t live with your dad, then the best thing you can do for him is STOP doing things for him. If you are a child who lives at home with him, then this could be a case for child protective services. In my state this is called DHS. A report is made to this organization for child abuse or neglect. Substance abuse in the home qualifies. Of course, alcohol is legal and when consumed in moderation, there is no problems. The problem will be the result of his alcohol consumption. Does he drive with children in the car while intoxicated? Is he left to care for minors while in an intoxicated state? Are there any domestic violence issues due to his drinking? This could be a reason for the authorities to step in. You can look for a local meeting for family members of alcoholics. They are similar to the AA meetings that an alcoholic should go to, but are for the family members. They can help you.","Here are some common and reliable sources of help in this region:

I believe it is wrong for men to look at inappropriate content. The father of my child has agreed to respect my beliefs. His co-worker sent him an inappropriate video. He got mad because he does not think he should tell his friend to not send him things like that.,"It sounds like you are wanting to protect your child from degrading images and that is one of the important parts of the job of a parent. Although it is challenging to supply an answer without knowing the full situation, it might be helpful to have a more broad discussion about what you both think about the influences and images that your child is exposed to and what you think your role is in protecting your child. This situation is one about beliefs and values and could well be an example you can use for exploring your parenting roles in protecting your child.","Dear friend, The father of the child would like your advice in the future to be very careful who he sends things or sends them to whom. If your co-worker says to his friend to do as he thinks he is, then his co-worker would be in a very bad situation. This shows a lot of respect, no matter what. This shows trust and responsibility to follow the instructions your co-worker gives you. Your co-worker probably is not wise."
"I'm a teenager. I get random spurts of anger, like complete, pure rage. I figured it was hormones, but others notice it too. I get self-destructive. I used to cut but stopped. Now when I get mad, I bite my arms and fingers, pull my hair, scratch my face, or punch my thighs. Basically, I do things I can hide instead of breaking anything in my room and having to explain it to my mom. I don't live in a bad household. I have a great family, a great relationship with my boyfriend, and a good job. I have no idea what this is and I don't know how to control it. It's over any little thing. Tonight, it was because I couldn't get my earrings out. This happens maybe two to three times on a good week, and it's always over stupid, petty things.","Hi. I'm glad you wrote. In general, when a small thing bothers us (and this happens to all of us), it's because the small thing triggers an emotion in us that we have felt ""too much"" or ""too intensely"" in the past, and we don't know how to manage that emotion effectively...we just want to avoid it as quickly as possible. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy with a qualified therapist can help you to understand what is being triggered in you and learn how to manage emotions productively. You say that your behaviours are self destructive, and I agree. It sounds like you have developed a habit of channelling your distress towards self-harm, and this is a separate and potentially more serious problem. This is a choice you make that points to shame being an issue for you. Again, a good therapist can help you learn what's behind your shame and self-harm. Your feelings are normal, and you can learn more healthy ways to deal with them with qualified help.","You're right, it has no relation to something you could use. Sometimes, there's no clear connection between what you do and what the cause is. Sometimes anger is a release of something else. This could have to do with you simply having an impulse. It has nothing to do with being an angry kid, if you're not. So, in the interest of yourself (being self-responsible) do some self-care. This could include trying to relax the body before it gets angry.  A way to do this is to take a bath or to have a good scrub.  If this is easy for you, try it.  You can also talk to your parents about your anger, and let them know what you are experiencing. They may be able to help you find a way to get better. It's a good idea to talk to a counselor about your anger. The advice of a counselor, is a chance for you to talk to someone other than your parents. Also know that they will probably be able to offer you some helpful advice."
I get very nervous and anxious/scared before sex.,"I first wonder what your anxiety or fear connects to. I don't know whether it is about sex itself or about ideas of worthiness or feeling desirable.There is also a difference between having self-doubt about the actual physicality of having sex (performance-related) or having doubts about whether you want to have sex with a particular person.Having sex can lead to feelings of great vulnerability. If your partner is someone you trust, consider discussing what it is that comes up for you around the issue of sex. This is the certain things that your partner would be willing to do that and the ease your discomfort, like staying with you for some time before and after sexual interactions.Another idea to consider is spending time with your partner and using nonsexual touch for each other (perhaps first you to him and then him to you) and communicating very clearly about what you like and do not like. Some people like to be spoken to during physical touch and other people do not. All of this can be part of your discussions. When you feel comfortable with that, you could move into sexual touch in this manner and actually look at what you do and do not like. You may also consider discussing things that are totally off-limits for you all the time and things for which you would like warning or awareness before they happen. There are really a number of different ways to work on becoming more comfortable if you trust your partner and if your concern is about sex itself.If this feels pretty structured, it is initially. Generally, the idea is to learn more about each other and yourselves and then the process becomes much more natural.If the concern relates more to self-esteem related sex, consider asking your partner to list several things that he or she likes about you. Even if you don't necessarily see yourself in the same light, consider that this is how your partner sees you, so these are some of the things that make you attractive to them (perhaps both in sexual ways and in a wider discussion of the relationship).If this is difficult for you to sort out on your own, consider seeing a therapist with experience working with couples or relationships.","If you feel you need to talk through your anxiety and anxiety about sex, such as with the permission of your partner, you can start by looking at what type of relationship you have with your partner. Relationships are complex and not always as easy to make the best of together as many people expect. If you know you need someone to help you feel more secure and relaxed before sex, that may be a good first step. Ask your partner what they think would help you feel more confident. There are lots of other factors such as medical conditions or medications could be affecting you, and it's good to get one of those checked out with a doctor so you have a definitive answer."
"My husband told me last year he never loved me and should have never married me. He's been talking about divorce, but he hasn't filed. Now he has a girlfriend and he abandoned me and his kids. He has no financial help, and he has been out of the home for four months. He became very angry and mean. He says it's all my fault, and that we're not compatible.",It's hard to say that it is a midlife crisis stage..  could be... but so much more seems to be going on or have been going on to say with confidence that it is not much more.,"There is a big issue with the way your husband communicates when things have been resolved. In order for a relationship to be healthy, you need to be able to communicate when the other person has been left off and have a problem with them. His problem is that he feels like he's been treated like a second-class person. At the same time, you do not get to blame him. Blaming him will not help solve the problem. Instead, listen to him talk. You can be supportive, but not involved in his decision and let him take the rest of the decisions for himself.  You may need to consider getting some counsel, as he may be dealing with issues that we cannot address."
I easily recognize this but have no control over it and need suggestions for managing my anger.,"I suggest that you work on emotional awareness. Emotional awareness basically means knowing what you are feeling and why.Emotional awareness also means that you can identify the link between the way you are feeling and your actions. In other words knowing that your feelings dictate what you do.Often feelings of hurt or insecurity can come out as anger if we cannot properly identify and express the feelings.Being emotionally aware also means that you are able to express your feelings to others. Being unable to do so leads to feelings of frustration and being misunderstood.Many people for many different reasons are not in touch with their emotions. For example, men traditionally have been brought up taught to not express sadness or weakness. Therefore, many men learned to turn feelings of sadness, insecurities, or fears into anger and express these feelings as anger. Being taught not to feel a certain emotion does not make that emotion disappear. Instead it makes us learn how to express it in other, incorrect, ways. If a man never learns to say “I am sad” or “that really hurt my feelings” and instead lashes out in anger, then the response they get from those around them will be to the anger and not a response to the underlying true feeling, which will leave the man feeling alone and misunderstood.You can control yourself and not explode. Walk away, remove yourself from the situation, do whatever you have to do to not lash out. Instead of reacting the way you normally would, go somewhere by yourself and think about what just happened and try to understand why such a “simple” thing upset you. What is the real feeling driving these outbursts? Maybe you can begin to recognize an underlying pattern. It might help to keep an anger journal. Write down everything that gets you upset. That might help you see a pattern and pinpoint what may be setting you off. Talking with a therapist about this would be beneficial in helping pinpoint the underlying cause of the outbursts you are experience.","What I find to be helpful is a combination of two techniques. First, I try to make my own assessment of the situation first. Ask ""What's happening?"" and decide if it's an issue to take action or not. Second, it's a very quick, short process of releasing my anger. I release my anger by saying that it is not my problem and my problem. Then, it is not my fault. I think what is important is to let it go. I don't react to it anymore."
"Two years ago, I was separated from the military into my contract for medical issues. It has emotionally destroyed me. I now basically hate myself. It's embarrassing to be separated from the one place who takes anyone. My family has been in the armed forces, and it has always been my dream. I can't do this alone anymore, and now my family is even worried.","It sounds like being separated from the armed forces is a major loss for you. It takes some time to work through the emotions related to this and it often takes longer if you are trying to work through it without a lot of support.Is there a task that you were doing during your military service that can in some way transfer into civilian life? I don't know what else your life involves, whether you have close friends or a romantic partner, a career, activities that you like to do, and many other things. You may be able to use some of the things that you still have today as a way to start moving forward in a different direction.Your military service will always be a part of you. Thank you for your service.","I would say, and it is probably more than I want to admit. So much of the ""disgust"" that you're feeling about your divorce probably has to do with what that divorce *represents* for you right now - and if you were to imagine what the war of one person and one community was like, it was not pretty. But right now you really don't want that war to be a part of you life. That is something you need to stop yourself from believing.You may have had some good experiences with one of your older friends and you might not want to lose that connection too. So you might think you are being guilty of having a bad one.You have to remember that while this is an awful period in your life, you are not guilty of it. The war itself isn't your fault, and the fact that you’re having a hard time is a sign of an unhealthy relationship with yourself and the world around you.It also is reasonable to assume you may not want your children to have the same feelings as you do about the divorce, so you might consider this when having this conversation."
All we do is argue. We never agree on anything.,"Simply, Yes!Just because you argue, does not mean your marriage is not worth it. Couples disagree. They are different people from different worlds with different likes and dislikes. Trying to mesh these different worlds is tough, but does not mean you don’t need to not be married.There are reasons why couples don’t get along. Finding out why you cannot compromise and working towards similar goals can help. Talking about what you really want out of the marriage and relationship may show y’all how much your relationship goals are similar. Then you can build upon that.Learning communication skills, listening skills and ways to improve your ability to express self without anger can help.","I know that we disagree often. The reason we don't agree is because we each have our own different ways of interpreting life and what we want to accomplish from it.We both have our own different goals, but I think we can agree to disagree when it comes to the subject. That's why we both don't need to agree on everything. We can be respectful and kind to each other, and that is something I believe is very important for all of us. If we do this the arguments will be less and less and more meaningful.If we do the opposite and agree on everything then we have missed the point of arguing.I think if we can do that, we can make out that we are different in the way we want to accomplish different things with our lives.  I wish everyone would do this for us.I hope that we can learn more about each other."
"I started dating a guy I met online. He told me that he registered sex offender but he didn't do anything. He took a plea to always register as sex offender and he did two years. That was more than two decades ago. Nothing on his record since. I always believe the past should be left in past. But my roommates, their family and my son are unforgiving. Should I forgive this man that I'm falling in love with or should I dump him? If I stay with him I will never see my family and granddaughter again.","Thank you for your question. Trust is a huge thing in relationships and when that is broken, or perceived as being broken, it takes a long time to repair. From what you shared, it sounds like your boyfriend took steps to correct the situation and has shown to be trustworthy since. Unfortunately, no matter how much we apologize for something we did or for something others perceive we did, there will always be those with hardened hearts and will not forgive. If you feel confident in your relationship, then trust your inner wisdom. We cannot control others but only ourselves. Respect your families wishes to remain in unforgiveness while at the same time, ask them to respect your wish to believe in him and be in this relationship. Good luck to you.","For you to fall into a relationship with someone that you know is likely to end in heartbreak and you think you may have all but fallen in love with a man who has a criminal past that is not reflected on his record can you forgive this man? If yes, then that would be something you may need to find for yourself! As the man who is your roommate is likely going to be very angry at your being in a relationship with him and that he's been in jail for so long that you have more than enough reasons to believe him to be a serial murderer or the worst type of person you have ever had the good fortune to meet. Do you wish to see the world in a new way, or do you not want to let this man and your children into your world?  I am sure you will remember the good that you have experienced from this person. If you can forgive him then you'll be able to spend the rest of your life with your family, and you will have a life full of love and happiness."
"I have three children: a biological daughter, a stepdaughter, and a stepson. I found out my stepdaughter overdosed today. My daughter blames me. I told her to stay out of it. I'm scared of all three kids now. They all blame me for their choices they made. All three have drug addictions. I had a stroke in 2013 so I need to depend on people from now on.","Blaming others is one of our greatest coping mechanisms.  It is not just for addiction, and often we blame the ones closest to us.  You can not stop them from blaming you, you can stop yourself for taking on the burden.  We are all in charge of the choices we make.  No one makes us do something other than our self.  We choose how we internalize and react to situations.  I would find a good therapist who understands family dynamics and addiction to help you cope with your current environment and help you move forward.","You are not alone in your concern to know who is holding a heavy weight. You're asking yourself questions and trying to understand a lot of things. It's natural to feel scared for your children and their families. Here are some things that you can do for yourself, and for them. You are brave for taking the time to ask questions and seek support. There are wonderful people in this world who can help and support you! Most especially you are not alone. Please remember to take care of yourself too. You are the main person you can depend on."
"My daughter didn't see her biological father for the last three years. She doesn’t want to see him because she remember really bad things from him such as domestic violence and child abuse. The visitation is with supervision, but she refuses to see him. Is it better to take my daughter to the therapist and try to see him after the therapy?","Hi Dillon,I'm from Canada, so I don't know the laws in your state. It depends on that a good deal, perhaps. In my opinion, a child should never be forced into a situation where they feel unsafe, even if it is ""supervised"". If the child is old enough to make a strong statement about not wanting to see a parent, then this should be honoured. Unfortunately, the laws don't always uphold a parent's right to do what is best for their child. I recommend you see a lawyer, who will advise you about how to proceed without putting yourself at risk of breaching custody agreements.If you feel your daughter can benefit from therapy, that is a separate question. Or is she already in therapy? A family therapist will typically meet with you alone first, in order to determine if therapy is a wise move for your child. It isn't always appropriate.","A good choice. I agree that if you feel safe around him, and if you think it’s likely your child is able to process these disturbing memories and learn how to handle them, then there are several options of seeing him. I know you want to put your daughter in a safe and supportive environment, but sometimes children have more difficult time processing these things so, your son might need some extra care and support.   So, if you have a relationship where he feels safe, there is a good chance that he will have the ability to process it and you can be there for him. If you don't know how to approach this in a way that is conducive to your son's healing, you can reach out to a therapist. Therapists are more likely to know how to work with children's trauma and this is best for you to do since you need to know all the details about your son's past and how they might be affecting him now."
"I've been hospitalized twice. Once was last month for psychiatric help. I'm on medicine, but I'm struggling with fighting the negative thoughts, irrational fears, and loneliness. The people around me aren't helping much.","If you are someone who usually has a job, pays or contributes to household bills, and generally manages your own daily life, then here are some suggestions.Start with small changes in your life so that you will feel successful in developing little areas of personal happiness.Since the people whom you currently are in your life ""aren't helping much"", consider branching out your life so that you are with those with whom you do feel help you.Follow your natural interests.  If you like reading, look online for a local book club.   If you like watching birds, look up a bird watching group.Social isolation increases the intensity of negative feelings.Also, the way healthcare is set up in the US, psychiatrists spend 15 minutes asking a person questions and then giving them a pill script.    There is almost no human interest in the person.If you'd like feeling better as a person, then find people.   Relying only on our mental health system will keep you feeling low and unsteady.If your life is a little more sheltered and you are in a group home setting or your basic needs are taken care of by someone or some organization, then similar advice is still valid.Find and participate in whatever human settings which appeal to you and are available on a somewhat regular basis.","You have the right to be happy with your medicine regimen, the decision to take medication is what has changed. The fact that you feel alone may be due to having had a difficult first experience with any doctor, and that they may have had a hard time understanding what you want and the purpose of the medicines you are taking to deal with depression. However, it is important to keep in mind that sometimes people are in the same state of mind when a medical doctor has a difficult time helping them to have a sense of purpose and meaning in their life. It is an ongoing process and what your therapist suggests, and you're not necessarily in a unique position."
I need to speak to someone about sexual addiction and binge eating immediately.,"There is an organization dedicated to helping individuals find affordable counseling.  It is called Open Path Collective.  There is a one time membership fee of $49 and it lasts for your lifetime.  You then have access to local counselors/therapists who will see you for an extremely reduced rate, anywhere from $30 - $60.   https://openpathcollective.org/","Okay, it is great that you are wanting to address this. As a therapist, I would say I would highly recommend that you seek out a therapist who specializes in sexual addiction, binge eating or co-occurring disorders. There are several therapists who specialize in sexual addiction, and binge eating, so a therapist with additional experience in your specific issue is a great way to learn and practice in a safe and compassionate environment.I'd suggest looking for a specialist who is familiar with your specific concerns, such as the reason behind your binge eating or sexual addiction and treatment options which are generally very safe for those with mental health issues. Good luck. You have the right to seek treatment!"
"I've been in a relationship for almost a year, and I absolutely trust my boyfriend. He treats me nice, checks on me, and tells me sweet things. However, when it comes to making life decisions, I feel he is very immature. I try to talk things out so we can compromise or make sound decisions together, but he lacks any ideas and prefers to just go with anything to avoid fighting. As far as dates, if I don't say anything, plan it, or have money to chip in, we will not go. I feel like I put in a lot of work supporting and sometimes spoiling, and all I get is a loyal man who will not cheat and say sweet things on occasion.","Well, then your decision is whether you want to stay in this type of relationship or not.One point to keep in mind is this.Just because he's not telling you his opinions doesn't mean he doesn't have any opinions.In the long run t is always easier to talk with someone about their differences from our point of view than to be someone who doesn't tell you what is in their mind.Short term it seems easy to have someone agreeable.Long term someone who doesn't tell you their thoughts and who disagrees with you, may potentially go about their true wishes in hidden ways.","I understand that the lack of ideas in a romantic relationship can feel like a loss of control, but we need to be very aware of the difference between taking a decision and having your feelings and experiences respected. Your husband is a good man, and this is the type of man that is good for you and your family.   I see he has a great idea when he talks to you about one thing, and he knows he is not correct when he goes on a decision. It's important that he and you can talk about it and come to the final decision together.  I do not need to get into some time with a boyfriend. I feel like I'm living with a good man who is loving and supportive and who I am still in love with. I don't expect him to be able to do all things for me. It's better for me if I try to get my life together while I am with him."
"I was raped by multiple men, and now I can't stand the sight of myself. I wear lingerie to get my self excited enough to have sex with my wife.","I am very sorry to hear about your rapes.  Traumatic events, such as rape, can have some lasting effects.  Issues with sex drive are one of these effects.  Therapy can help to decrease the impact that traumatic events have upon our lives as we process through some of our experiences.   EMDR can be a particularly effective modality of treatment to address this issues.  I would also encourage you to have an honest conversation with your wife about this concern.  Sometimes it is helpful to have that conversation with a therapist so that the therapist can help educate  your wife in regards to effects of trauma.  This may help her understand that your feelings are more about the trauma and less about her as a person.  Best of luck to you!","First, if you are still considering it, you may be able to seek professional advice from a therapist that specializes in intimate partner trauma.  If you don't know how to make it feel safe in your own skin for yourself, then this may not be the right time for you to consider that.   I wish you the best of luck on this journey."
"I'm in love with my own gender, and my parents are against that. I don't know how to tell them because I'm afraid they'll not want me anymore.","Hello, and thank you for your question. This is one of those times when you wish you could assure someone that everything will go perfectly, but unfortunately I can't do that. There is no way of knowing how parents might respond until you tell them. The truth is that people have come out to their parents in many different ways. Some have told their parents directly, some drop hints, some have had others tell their parents, etc. The only ""right"" way to come out is the one that you choose. The one that feels right to you. That is the best way. Some people decide not to come out, and some wait for a very long time. Both of these things are okay. Coming out is deeply personal, and there can be real consequences to someone's emotional health and safety if they tell the wrong person. That is why it should only be done when you are ready. When you feel that you have the emotional and personal support that you need to take the risk. Sometimes people can feel pressured to come out, but I encourage you to do it in your own time. The truth is, there is a spectrum of how people's parents react to this kind of news. On one end, you may have the parents who shut a person out and are abusive, and on the opposite side you may have parents that are totally okay with it and throw you a ""Coming Out"" party. Most parents are going to fall somewhere in the middle. It is important to remember that their feelings may change over time. Many parents struggle at first, but they love their kids and get better with it over time. If you decide to tell them, consider taking someone along to support you. Plan ahead on what you want to say. It can be an emotional time, so do what you need to do to take care of yourself. If you need to, leave. You don't have to stay anywhere where someone is being cruel to you. I wish you well, and good luck.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC","Is a healthy parent also a good parent?  Is that the goal?  Is a good parent always a good lover?  Are you sure you love each other?  If you're thinking about wanting to be with yourself, and it's not a good time for your parents, your first job is to understand your own feelings and your goals.  Are they right for you?  Do you have a good sense of who you are?  What do you want out of life?  When your parents and you get together, how do you feel?  What do they do and what do they not do?  Ask yourself the questions in the last paragraph.  What do you hope for them?  When you feel like there's no way to satisfy you, think about why.  You can't help anyone you don't like, so your focus should be on yourself and yourself's good and safe-but not necessarily happy.  When people stop loving you, you can start wondering if you can do better.  Only try to keep in touch and see if the change is positive.  You also may want to consider a therapist to assist you with figuring out what you want and need from a relationship.  Good luck?  I hope that you and your parents are able to get more time together soon."
"I have been diagnosed with ADHD and experienced manic depression episodes. I have problems with anger management. Apparently, I also have an ODD, bipolar and split personality. How can I be truly happy?","The ADHD and manic depressive episodes are terms other people told you that you have.You don't have to accept these words to describe who you are.A lot of mental health in our country is about telling people what's wrong with them and giving pills for these so called conditions, instead of helping a person know more about themselves in order to make good decisions.You can be happy because nothing from the outside, such as the names people have used to tell you who you are, can interfere with your own wish to be happy.Others can slow you down because of the self-doubt and hurt feelings.  No one can take happiness from you, only they can make it harder to find and hold onto.Anger management only works temporarily because it is a surface approach.Think of the reason you are angry.  This will be better to know so you will be able to address it.Then you will not have anger to manage.","Congratulations for taking it on and for reaching out for help. You have been diagnosed with ADHD, bipolar disorder, and the most troubling of all of these traits as your ""Split Personality"" may point to a possible personality disorder. Let's take on your question from the start and then delve into the question of being truly happy in life. It sounds like you have many life obstacles and if you are looking at your own life from this point of view, if you are truly happy, then you may need to re-evaluate your own life goals, and what ""happiness"" looks like for you personally. Happiness is something that is subjective to each person.&#x20;If ""happiness"" means you're being joyful, fulfilling your own needs, or connecting with the people in your life to help make it so...well, then you're well on your way to making it so! But if you mean a ""world-saving"" happiness, then that may require a different set of circumstances than what you currently feel you need.&#x20;If you are currently not enjoying the good parts of your day, and being more joyful in general, then there may be steps you can take.It's also possible that there are additional factors contributing to unhappiness, which could be linked to your situation.If you've never had any real therapy, it may be worth considering taking some time to go to a therapist. If you're in your 20's and feel like there is a level of unhappiness, then you may have to work on the aspects you have had little chance to explore before.   In other words, work on the parts that you feel that have to be addressed before you can be truly happy.If you have trouble getting into therapy, there are many other resources that might help too. There are people who may be great for listening to you at first, and they don't need any more data to begin with. There is even online groups that may give you the feel of what you're looking for."
"I have a really bad temper. I get mad very easily then stay like that the whole day. I don't mean to be that way, but I can't help it.","A lot of times the anger someone expresses is from feeling a deep level hurt within themselves.   A surface situation, like, a store told you they'd have delivery of a certain item by Tuesday, and when that particular Tuesday comes, the store doesn't have what they told you they would, and you are furious.The fury may have more with many times before in your life, having been deeply let down by someone who mattered to your life at the time, who similarly promised something and failed to deliver whatever it.If at the time of feeling let down by someone important in your life, the relationship didn't allow for honest expression of all your emotions, you'd have learned to hold in what you realized would not be tolerated if you expressed it clearly.Without practice of being heard when feeling hurt by someone, eventually the person, possibly you, learned to contain and contain your emotions.It is possible that the anger you feel at a variety of situations lately, are muting hurt feelings that you've understood from relating to meaningful people in your personal history, to not talk about.As a way to find out if you feel other emotions in addition to anger, take some time to reflect on what triggered your anger and whether its possible that hurt emotions which nobody whom you know wants to hear,  are really the underlying source of your upset.I hope you will enjoy some new discoveries about yourself and your emotions!","If you could help your body to calm down so you don't get mad during the day, then you can do it. Stressing and getting angry is not a good skill to have. It's not something that is really helpful with the long term. What is helpful is knowing that you can control what you are feeling. Also, understanding how you feel in an anger is useful. You may be able to change how you feel.  You don't have to always be angry, sometimes you can have a mild feeling, but then it gets worse. You can also learn to use your body to help release the emotion. These can vary from small squeezes of your neck or shoulders, stretching out your arms and twisting your wrists, or using your breath to calm down. If you feel that your anger is causing you problems with your relationship with your family, then talk to them about how you feel. And let them know you have a good way to calm down when your anger comes on."
I'm constantly in a bad mood and I have no energy. Is that depression?,"Depression has many different signs and symptoms and looks different for every person.  Often times people think depression is more about feeling ""sad,"" but depression can, in fact, express itself through irritability (or bad mood as you say) and lack of energy.  According to the DSM-V (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), depression includes the following symptoms:-Depressed mood-Irritable mood-Decreased interest or pleasure in activities you usually participate in or enjoy-Significant weight change or change in appetite-Change in sleep (insomnia or hypersomnia)-Psychomotor aggitation or retardation-Fatigue or loss in energy -Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt-Diminished ability to concentrate or indecisiveness-Thoughts of suicide or plan The great news is that there are many ways to improve depressive symptoms.  If you are up for it, perhaps the best place to start is by seeing a physician or a therapist who can help determine how severe the depression is and can suggest methods of addressing the depression that fit your lifestyle, values, and capabilities.  Good luck!","No, sadness, low energy and depression are not the same thing. Although, depression can be accompanied by low energy.  If you are having symptoms of depression, you should contact your therapist for help. Your therapist can help you identify the symptoms of depression, as well as the causes of these symptoms. You could also talk to your doctor for a referral to a mental health professional. The same goes for your physical health, if your symptoms are not physically causing you your sadness and low energy, it may be that it's a chemical imbalance in the brain.  This can be resolved, but it will need a physical diagnosis from a doctor."
"I feel like every time I do something someone asks me to, I never fully meet what they want. I feel that when I finish it, they always think that they should have picked someone else to do it. I feel like they just want nothing to do with me.","It sounds like you have the perception that people are frequently disappointed in you, wish you were different or someone else, and ultimately reject you. One question I would have for you is what is your evidence that people feel this way? Is there anything in people's words or behaviors that gives you this impression? If your not sure, it may be useful for you to try to notice what people say and do in response to you, even though you perceive these attitudes within them. Additionally, working with a competent therapist may be a great way to get an answer to your question as well as developing ways to move forward with that answer and gain a sense of self-esteem and security in your relationships.One possibility that comes to mind, of which there may be more, is that as we grow up, we often develop relational templates, or sets of expectations about how people are and will relate to us, which influence our experiences and behavior in relationships. Sometimes the templates that we develop to stay connected growing up are not particularly adaptive for adult life and can hamper our self-esteem and capacity for comfortable intimacy as an adult. You ask a great question here, and one that can be very hard to see through, given the difficulty of feeling that people think of you in this way, and I hope that you will stay curious about this and consider working with a therapist who is trained to help you discover the answer.","It's easy for us to compare what we are doing with what we want to do, and it creates a negative cycle.  There are several ways to shift this cycle: one is to notice and reflect on what happened, then notice how that influenced you. The other is to give yourself some time for reflection. Write out the last time it felt like you failed, and write down all you had to do for it. Then ask yourself, ""What was your goal when we were working on this task together?"" Usually, it is to get the job done. A good way to help with this is to ask yourself: ""What am I really trying to achieve by doing this task?"" A helpful reminder to the client is that we are responsible for what we do, and the results are not always in our control."
