"I found out today that my wife is cheating on me. I love her, but she won’t tell the truth even when I have proof. When I beg her to tell the truth, she yells, cusses, and gets a huge attitude.","Hi Prattville, I'm sorry this is happening to you. You need support right now, and yes, you need answers. She is in denial and is trying to hide the truth, to protect herself. This is a natural behaviour. You don't indicate whether she wants the marriage, or is planning to leave. Which way you go from here depends in part on the answer to that question. If she wants the marriage, you certainly have the right to say ""I need answers to all my questions"". Giving you the information she needs has to be (if she wants the marriage) more important than protecting herself. I would support your right to advocate for all the information you need in order to feel secure or make decisions. She may fear that the truth will turn you away. If you want to, you can reassure her that you want the marriage no matter what the truth is. If the marriage is to survive, it needs openness.If, on the other hand, she's planning to end the marriage, then you might want to resign yourself to the fact that you may never get the information you seek. You are better off, in that case, seeking support from friends and family rather than beating on a closed door. Your wife has some decisions to make. Try to give her a bit of time to make them. You can patiently say ""I know this thing is happening. Talk to me so we can deal with it together. I want to move forward but I need the truth."" Only time (and a good therapist, if she is willing and wants the marriage) will tell which way this one will go. Individually, you can seek professional help as well.","The amount of stress you have and the thought of having to go to court is terrible.  If your wife does not want to continue the affair and wants to work to get your marriage back to where it was, then maybe it is the right time for you to discuss your options with a mediator. It might seem like a large amount of money to spend, but the fact that you are getting help with this situation to try and get back together is the most important thing.  If you don't talk to your wife, you could end up with no respect for yourself for not communicating and a bad marriage. It's also worth considering how your wife would feel if she knew you would go through with it."
"My coworkers are making false statements about me to the boss, saying I have mood swings. They have no proof to back it up. Can my employer make me see a therapist of their choice?","If this is a concern of a few coworkers, make sure it is not something they see but you don't admit to.  Employers can ""suggest"" or something ""stipulate"" in continued employment with them  for you to go to their Employment Assistance Provider (EAP) if they have noticed the same behavior and concerned of how it is effecting productivity or employee relationships.  No one wants to work in a environment which they consider hostile.  Employers can be held responsible if they do not take action.Couple of things you can do...Ask a coworker in which you trust and respect if what others are saying is true?Seek professional help from your primary care provider or counselor if mood swings do exist.","I can't help you with your question, because I do not have the legal expertise to answer questions that question legal rights and/or conflicts of interest. It's best for you to consult an attorney."
"My boyfriend is in Ireland for 11 days, and I am an emotional wreck.","It sounds like you and your boyfriend are very close.  Do you typically spend most of your time together?  If so, it may be important to reflect on how you feel when you are apart.  If any separation is difficult, you may need to examine why.  Think about what it is that you miss and what you are anxious, upset or worried about.  If you examine the causes of your distress you likely will experience some relief.   It is important to learn how to be happy when you are alone, it will only improve the way you feel when you are with your boyfriend.","Sounds like your emotional state has taken the floor - 11 days seems like an unusually long time. The idea of being so emotionally wrecked for so long in a place where you are alone seems very odd.  It may seem like you are experiencing some weird anxiety. This is something to research, and talk to a professional about. Here's what I would suggest.  First, be honest with yourself about who is causing you pain. You need to figure out in order to figure out this whole situation.  Second, talk to your boyfriend about the fact that he is out of your sight and that his behaviour has changed (I read an article about the fact that it's quite common for relationship issues to arise after the first year or two of a relationship. The fact this is happening is a good sign). Finally, take care of yourself during this time. Take a few minutes each day to breathe and see the good that you have.  It may not be enough, but the idea that you have some to the relationship's value, is a good thing."
"When my daughter is stressed about a silly thing from school, she starts crying and freaking out. She is a bright student, always has a 4.0, but I am afraid she is stressing too much. I’m afraid it’s going to break her. I don't know if I should get her to a doctor or someone because this is not normal.","Watching children go through challenges in their lives is difficult. On a very basic level, There exists a primal need to protect them from harm. The hard part for parents is letting them feel those challenges and working through them as they get older. At some point, there is a moment that occurs when the role as a parent shifts. Children no longer need the basics (food, shelter. water, safety) as much as when they were toddlers, but rather, their needs shift to wanting more support, encouragement, advice, and room to make mistakes. This is where the ability to communicate with them, letting them direct the sails to gather the wind needed to move, is so important. Keep the lines of communication open and be available to give feedback when they ask for it.",You are right; it would be good for your daughter to receive a medical check and to talk with a school counselor. The fact that she is crying or feeling overwhelmed shows that something might be going on that needs further exploration. The anxiety that her teacher is going to be able to help her find the right therapist is a good start too.  Ask your daughter to tell you if the teacher can help her to feel better. You can even bring her to the school with you; she may know someone who could assist her.
"It was over 20 years ago, but the pain has resurfaced again now because I have started seeing her Facebook posts about how great her life is. I feel so angry. How can I handle this?","Emotional pain is different from physical pain that way, isn't it? Even many years later, an old wound can be ripped open again by a small trigger.You were betrayed by two people close to you. That's a complex injury. I don't know whether you're still in the marriage or not, or whether your sister is still in your life. Perhaps not, as your contact with her seems to be through watching her facebook activity. I'm curious about why you're just now seeing her facebook posts again. Are you feeling more open lately to seeing how she's doing in her life? I guess if you were open to having your sister even in the periphery of your life again, you will have to figure out how to handle those triggers. If you can't, maybe consider unfollowing her or detaching from facebook for a while. So your sister is happy, or she at least appears happy. Your mind might go to some unhelpful places, like ""She doesn't regret the affair"" (you don't know that), ""She doesn't deserve happiness"" (that would be a harsh judgement), or ""She doesn't care that I'm hurt"" (again, there's no evidence of that). Where does your mind go? It's important to identify your worst thoughts in connection to her. When you have those worst thoughts identified, ask yourself ""What evidence supports that thought as truth?"" It's likely that either there's no evidence, or that the truth is so far from you that you can't know what she's feeling or thinking, which makes having those thoughts pretty futile.A therapist can help you determine what emotions are being triggered here. It doesn't help you and your happiness to carry around resentment, ill wishes, or the need for revenge. Forgiveness is not about saying that something was ""okay"". It's about saying ""It happened. I accept that I can't change it, and I don't want to carry the emotional burden around all the time"". Forgiveness is putting it down. She... (trust me this is true)...she carries her own burden of shame for what she did. For you to spend time feeling angry doesn't affect her burden. It only adds to yours. Can you find the tender emotion under your anger? You're hurt. Validate that hurt. Honour that hurt. Take care of that hurt. You can stay away from people who disregard your needs, and you have the power to forgive those who make mistakes out of their simple humanity if you want them in your life. If you continue to struggle, please seek the help of a professional who can assist you in navigating these waters. :)","Hi there!  How lovely to hear you enjoy looking at her Facebook posts about how great her life is. Your feelings are entirely valid I feel very similar with when I have been seeing her posts of her's for a long time. I wonder if it is because, through the process of looking at her's posts about life, she has learned to like to think about the best of life to help other people be better off. It feels good when you are happy and feel satisfied that you have created a good life for yourself. I wonder if you have become resentful towards her and her life. A lot of these things, I'm sure, would be easier to live with when we all have different life experiences. If I'm honest and it has been the same way for you, there are a lot of things to consider when you're feeling resentment towards someone.  It is one thing to look at her and see her life and another thing to feel resentful towards her for having the good life you have. I wonder whether you were expecting her to be the person you want her to be?  I would strongly suggest you reach out to her directly as to what she may or may not feel about how you are feeling in a respectful way.  You want to avoid getting emotional, you want to listen to her answer, but you want to understand whether this is what she is comfortable with.  Maybe you are angry because you feel like you're the only one who cares as much about her happiness as you do, as well as she is very busy with all sorts of things. Maybe this is just part of the process.  It may come with time.   I want to stress that, if you aren't in touch with her, there may be reasons that she hasn't been able to keep in touch with you.  It is very possible that she may not have been the best person to share the positive updates with."
"I start to think of an issue that doesn't even matter or something bad that happened years ago. Then, I cry, pull at my hair, plug my ears, hit myself, and throw things. In loud public places, I get on edge and start being sarcastic and moody. I have an awful fear of people leaving me (which normally ends up happening) and I feel like I'm too clingy.","There is a reason you are having breakdowns. I can't agree that they happen for ""no reason at all"".   Finding out the reason is going to be your biggest challenge because that may require you to dig deep into your past, uncover hurtful experiences, or recognize something that would be extremely pain.  However, if you don't find professional help to carefully guide you through whatever you may confront, the symptoms mentioned will continue and may even get worse.  There is a light at the end of the road but you need some help to find the right road to get on so you can see it.","When you are doing something like this that you've tried for a long time with no results. The people that your behaviour shows are indicative of an underlying issue: An intense fear of abandonment. (See if you can do some research into this) Often it comes down to old scars from childhood experiences, like having a parent give a lot of reasons for their relationship ending up failing. The more you allow yourself to experience those old scars, the more likely the emotions for anxiety and depression become. This could involve lots of feelings of hurt.  These feelings are natural, but if they’re ignored and allowed to linger, they can become very, very powerful.  If you're worried about the potential harm that you may be causing in the long term, it's wise to seek the help of someone experienced in working with someone who has been traumatized.   The goal of the work is to deal with this kind of fear in a healthier way.&#x20;If you want to find out about healthy ways of managing the anger and sadness that you are feeling as a result of this fear of being left, here are some places you can look to get some information on the internet :  1   <https://www.facebook.com/groups/1562996138323487/> <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eT242tXJvQ>   2   <https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/nov/17/can-we-really-trust-anyone >   3   <https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/treatment-information/anxiety-and-depression>   4   <https://www.mayoclinic.org/diagnosis-treatment/depression/diagnosis/stages/hr/sinfo/repwatch-10359806>   5   <https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/emotional-intelligence/201809/5-signs-you-are-over-trusting-"
"My wife works late most days, so I'm lonely. I love my wife with all my heart, however I don't feel the intimacy we used to have. We don't have sex anymore, which bothers me tremendously. I have become close friends with a coworker, which I know is not helping. Nothing will happen with that, but there’s the thought.","First things first!  Friendships that develop in times of struggle may be a great emotional support, but also become confusing there's sexual attraction. And entertaining a tough is only going to make it a stronger target.  Careful with that friendship! You do not want to fill your marriage's void with another person.  Even when you are in a friend zone and not having intimacy with this person, you may be developing a special bond, sharing interest and activities that may lead to a deeper connection.  Ask yourself how you would feel if your spouse was having a friendship like that.Then try to refocus on your marriage. I suggest being transparent and talking to your wife about your feelings and concerns.  Ask her what you could do to reconnect, make some suggestions and dedicate time to practice them.  Make time in both of your schedules, make an effort to have lunch together, or to text during the day.  Remember that a marriage is like a very good friendship with benefits, but sometimes the responsibility kills the fun.¿Cómo puedo volver a enamorarme de mi esposa?Mi esposa trabaja tarde casi todos los días, la amo con todo mi corazón, pero no siento la intimidad como antes.  Ya no tenemos sexo, lo cual me molesta tremendamente.  Me he acercado a una amistad del trabajo, lo cual no ayuda.  Nada pasara, pero hay pensamientos al respecto.Primero lo primero! Las amistades que se desarrollan en momentos de crisis pueden ser un gran apoyo emocional, pero también pueden convertirse en algo nebuloso cuando hay atracción sexual. Entretener pensamientos al respecto solo lo va a hacer un reto más grande.  ¡Ten cuidado con esa amistad! No quieres llenar el vacío que deja tu matrimonio con esta nueva persona.  Aunque no estés teniendo intimidad con esa persona, puedes estar creando una conexión especial, compartiendo intereses en común y actividades que los unen más aun. Pregúntate como te sentirías si tu esposa tuviera una amistad así.Intenta reenfocarte en tu matrimonio.  Sugiero que seas transparente con tu esposa y le dejes saber tu preocupación y como te sientes con el distanciamiento.  Pregúntale que le gustaría hacer para reconectarse, sugiérele algunas ideas y dediquen tiempo a las mismas.  Hagan tiempo en sus agendas para ustedes, hagan un esfuerzo para almorzar juntos, y comunicarse durante el día, aunque sea con textos.  Recuerda que el matrimonio es como una muy buena amistad con beneficios y muchas veces las responsabilidades matan la diversión.","Hi There! I am glad you and your wife love each other so much! Is it helpful to look at each other and be honest about how you're feeling about the new friendship?  The more you know the feelings and needs of each other, the more you can understand each other's needs. Is one of you feeling very lonely and does this seem like that to you, or more of a general longing for love and connection?"
"My boyfriend shows affection, but I just push him away. Every time my boyfriend tries to kiss, hug, or touch me I almost always push him away. I'm on birth control and it has killed my sex drive.     I love him so much. Why do I do this?","There could be many reasons that you push your boyfriend away. It could be part of how you were raised, it could be because of culture, it could even be your own insecurities about yourself that are then outwardly manifested in you ""pushing"" him away. What is important in all this is that you both find a way to connect. So what if you aren't a hugger, a kisser, or a toucher you have to find what works for the both of you and your relationship. There are many ways to show affection that aren't physical (words of affirmation, giving of time and/or gifts, etc). If your boyfriend wants the physical attention then work on ways that are comfortable for the both of you making sure to start out slow and to work your way up to more physical touching.","I'm so sorry you're experiencing this... the best part is you're on birth control, so that part isn't related to the reason for the issue. Birth control has lowered the sex drive of many women and because of that, you're putting it off, and this does not align with how your brain works. People with lower sex drive often find it hard to have great sex, and when we don't get sexual excitement, our brains are like a broken machine that doesn't work properly. The fact that you push him away at the most intimate moment in this situation, indicates this issue is more than a normal phase of a woman's hormone cycle.  Also, because of the birth control, there may be other things in your life causing you stress and anxiety and pushing you away from this. If that's the case, it may also be helpful to talk to your doctor to see what your body is capable of."
I haven't been feeling like myself lately. I've been upset for no reason and feeling anxious. I'm feeling burnt out. What can help me feel better?,"Does it help to put a name to the experience you are having? Where you first said, ""I've been upset for no reason and feeling anxious,"" you then say that you are ""feeling burnt out,"" which gives a little more context to what may have once felt like ""no reason."" Perhaps you are feeling burnt out! That is a big deal, and please try not to take it lightly! When we get burnt out, I have found that it's from one of two things: either we are not doing what we want, or we are doing too much (either of something we want or something we don't, doesn't really matter once we get into doing too much.)If either of those rings true for your experience, try as much as possible to sit with the experience and get a better sense of where the burn out is coming from. I wrote about burnout for a newsletter and it is on my website. I don't want to do shameless promotion, but I thought it could also add to helping you: https://davidkleintherapy.com/my-experiences-with-burnout/I hope that you can also see that it's not an abnormal experience.","Anxiety and burnout are both serious issues that affect people. When someone is anxious and burned out, it is important to identify any potential underlying causes for these feelings. Sometimes anxiety can come from anxiety itself; by identifying any additional stressors in your life, you may notice that your worry is disproportionate to the problems you are facing. When you feel burnt out, it could be due to job issues, relationship problems, personal issues, or a combination of factors. Once you've identified the possible causes of these two things, you can take steps to help yourself feel better."
"There is just no communication at all between us. She sleeps constantly all day (not at night). She acts angry and unfocused and stays in her very messy room all the time. The only time she comes out is to eat.    She has aches and fatigue, weight gain, hair loss and skin problems. She does not look after her health.
   I don't know how to communicate with her. She is not open to any suggestions. How do I get through to her?","1. She's an adult.2. She lives in your house? She follows your rules.3. What you're describing could be any number of things, but could potentially be a medical issue that needs attention. Thyroid issues, autoimmune diseases - there's a ton of medical possibilities for her symptoms. I'm not a doctor; this is a forum of therapists.4. I recommend the book ""Codependent No More"" which may help you navigate your rocky relationship with your adult daughter. You may be inadvertently making things worse by ""helping"" her which can instead enable her to continue her behaviors. Another book you may find helpful is ""Boundaries: Where you end and I begin"". You cannot control another person, especially an adult. The only person you can control is yourself. Tough love is sometimes needed, and she is an adult - treat her like one. Maybe then she'll act like one. If we were having this conversation in person, you would interrupt me at this point with a ""but..."" and then explain all the reasons why you can't tell her to move out, get a job, get up and cook or clean the house, etc. I already know that you have a myriad of excuses for things being the way they are. Yes, I said excuses instead of reasons, because that's what they are. You may feel stuck and like you have to take care of her, but you have choices - you just may not like them. I know that when children are small, parents' lives are focused around them (some more than others) and decisions are made around what is best for your child. But you said your daughter is an adult. The relationship dynamics must change if the relationship is to be a healthy one. I know how difficult it is to watch your child make life choices that you wouldn't want for them, no matter what that choice may be. As a parent, we want to force them to do what we think is ""the right thing"" but trying to do that only results in frustrations for everyone involved. Whether the issue is a hair color, a tattoo, a lifestyle choice, a job, or choosing not to work or take care of their health, or doing drugs, or drinking - the choice is theirs and theirs alone and so are the consequences of those choices.","I think there may be some medical issues here that need addressing. What you are describing also makes sense to me. Sleep disturbances and exhaustion can cause anxiety and depression, anxiety and depression can cause sleep disturbances and fatigue. Physical symptoms like weight gain and hair loss can feel like they're not linked to something psychological and also feel connected to sleep. So a very bad sleep pattern may be causing anxiety and depression and not being dealt with at all. Also, the physical symptoms suggest she is not taking care of herself! I don't know what causes the physical symptoms but it is most likely related to what she is not taking care of in this moment and right now.I want to encourage you to talk with her about what she is telling you about it!"
My two adult sons live with me. One has been having panic attacks and hasn't been able to work for over 6 months. He doesn't want to get help. I'm feeling so overwhelmed. What can I do?,"My very first thought is this is so much to carry on your own!  A mother's instinct is to care for her children so I can imagine how hard it must be to see your son in pain and struggling.  I hear a ping of helplessness in there as well.  That's heavy.My question is: who is supporting you?  I know nothing about the context, but I wonder if the role you hold often is that of caretaker.  It may not be that the end-all-be-all answer is to be cared for, but the absence of care (or even self-care) can seem like we are only existing for others.  Sometimes having someone to rely on can help take off some of the edge--the pressure--of all that is overwhelming.Despite that, it may be that the situation continues to be exactly what it is, providing a steady stream of stress for you (which would be so difficult).  I don't think anyone can tell you what to do because no one here has to live with those consequences, good or bad.  Just a note that sometimes with men it is harder to reach out for help.  Perhaps he feels comfortable enough for you to know he's struggling (which means you have provided him a safe space to do just that) but not comfortable enough to interact with a stranger about those same struggles.  Men often avoid therapy because it's seen as weak and/or means you need help.  Planting seeds here is sometimes all you can do, as hard as that is.As far as supporting goes, there's much more you can do there if he is ready to receive that.  If you are seeing him in the midst of panic, the best thing you can do is let him know you are there for him.  Maybe that means being there physically, or continuing to give him encouragement along the way (e.g., ""You got this"", ""I know this is hard"", etc.).  If you aren't present for the attacks but he's telling you about them, you can ask what you can provide for him in those moments or how you can help him afterward.  Panic attacks can be taxing on the body so sometimes people need time to recover.  Remember that you also need to recover here, too.  It's very painful to watch someone you love panic.  What might you need there?Of course, counseling can be a great place to work through that stress and overwhelm.  That time is all for you to be heard and understood.  You deserve to have someone there for you, too!","Dear Friend,  You\u000fjust\u000funderstand\u000fthe other person's mindset.  Most adults are unwilling to go to the doctors because they are scared of being judged, and they have to go to the doctor to prove how sick they really are.  This is why it doesn't make sense to do what you have done. You are now in a difficult position and have more to do with your sons and their behavior.  This isn't the way you should treat your children.  If you love your sons and want your family to be happy, and you see what they're doing, then you need to call in a professional.  It is one way to get your sons to stop behaving.  That way you can focus on your relationship.  A professional can help your sons improve their self-esteem, change bad behaviors, and change the way they relate to each other.  You can talk to him about it and get some help.  It is also possible that you should talk to your son about it, and ask him what his experience is like and help him through that situation.  Your goal is to be there for him and you can ask if he is willing to seek help as well.  If your sons not open to seeking help, then there is no point in going to see a professional.  If your sons are too young to ask for help, you may need to consult your legal authority - perhaps your mother or spouse - with the help of your son in order to get the help they need.  The goal here is to have your sons learn how to be a little nicer to one another.  Once your sons are in a better place with one another, they are less likely to take advantage of you when they feel left out.  The goal is to be happy with your sons, and if that involves taking care of your feelings, then ask for help.  How can you do this?  Can you see a therapist for yourself and talk to your sons about it?  You can do this in a healthy way.  The first step is to say to your son that he will only start seeking help once"
"I'm a male in my early 20s. Lately, my paranoia about being around kids is causing me too breathe heavy and sweat a lot. I then start to act weird because I'm trying to fight my paranoia. This leads to people starring at me because they don't know that I'm suffering from panic attacks and paranoia. They just notice me acting scared around kids and they think I'm a threat because of it.    I'm not a pervert or predator. I would never hurt a kid. I like kids and don't know why I'm so scared to be around them.    I don't understand why I feel like this. Am I a bad person? How do I make this stop?","In our practice, many people we see have unwanted thoughts of doing harm to children - physically or sexually. As you said, these are intrusive and unwanted thoughts - not genuine desires to harm them. This is a form of OCD we often call Harm or Pedophilic OCD. What you are describing here as ""paranoia"" sounds similar to this, and is so demoralizing because you are dealing both with the distress of these unwanted thoughts and feelings, as well as the fear and uncertainty about your own character as a good person.If this is really what is going on (further assessment by the right professional would determine this), the current gold standard approach to addressing OCD is Exposure with Response Prevention - in this case, confronting the feared situations, thoughts or images on purpose, rather than avoiding them, until they lose the fear and shame associated with them.","Thank you for sharing your experience. The fact that you're already addressing this situation in a thoughtful way speaks volumes about your willingness to work through that fear or lack thereof.  This, of course, is not the time to look for answers to the following question: Is there something I do, that I need to address if I want to feel safe around children in general. I suspect there isn't. People are in a state of fear and anxiety and it's likely all from there. You would have to spend some time learning more about the source of your panic and anxiety, but it does come from a place of feeling unconfident about your feelings.  In fact, you're being really brave by speaking your truth about these things.  It sounds as though you have already identified what you need to do, and that is that you will learn more about and handle your anxiety. This is something that we can address together.&#x20;"
I'm very depressed. How do I find someone to talk to?,"You have already taken the brave first step of making the decision to heal from it and find a professional that will help you do so. There are lots of different options nowadays for therapists, as you can see them online or in an office.  My biggest tip for you is to use Psychology Today or Counsel Chat to find a therapist.  Enter in your zip code and you will find many different therapists you can talk to . Be sure to find someone that you most resonate with and ask them any questions you may have. Many  times, therapists will provide free consultations and this can be a great opportunity to see if you are a good fit.","You've described the classic ""Grey Rock"" behavior, which is one of the most useful ways to find someone to talk with and have someone want to listen to you. There are a couple of ways to do that to find someone to talk to, if you have support or friends to reach out to.  1. Find someone who is open to knowing about your depression.   2. Start to spend time with them, and if you have the opportunity to talk with them, and both of you want to talk, ask them about how they cope with depression.  3. If you are able to, you can ask one of your friends and family members if they can reach out to you.  4. Listen and wait, and trust that they will reach out to you when they want to.  5. If you are not having any support, consider joining a peer support group and connecting with other people who are dealing with depression.  6. It may be a little scary for you to talk about how you feel, but there is no shame in it.  7. You need to start to feel in control of your life again and trust that something will change.  8. There are a few other things that you can try to do that may also help you feel better.  9. Talk to a doctor about what it is like to be depressed.  10. Be patient with yourself.  11. Let yourself feel your emotions, even the nasty ones.  12. Remember that you're not alone.  13. Ask for help as needed.  14. You may not be in this state for a long time, but you can find out what you need to move into a better way of living.  15. Treat yourself kindly.  16. Do not be afraid of feeling anything.  17. It is okay to get help.  18. It is okay to feel sad.  19. It is okay to be angry.  20. You will have the opportunity to heal and feel better.  21. You have the power to choose how to live your life.   22. You don't have to feel like you should be happy all the time, I am not sure you need to"
"I don't know what's with me. I'm almost constantly angry. Even when I'm happy, I still feel anger inside me. When I acknowledge it, it ruins my mood and takes over. I get angry at the littlest things. Even if I think someone said something they didn't, it infuriates me. Something perfectly normal can make me go off. When my anger flares up, I get a terrible pain in my chest that lasts for a while. It's like there is a fire constantly burning in my body, and anger is gasoline.","Hi Nashville, I'm glad you want this to be different. It doesn't feel good to be angry all the time, and it's stealing your energy as well as affecting relationships, I'm sure.Working with a therapist, you can learn to recognise the deep emotions that lie underneath the anger. It's likely to be either powerlessness or worthlessness, and what happens is this... a small moment in the present touches on an old, tender, bruised emotion that we've simply felt too much of or too strongly in the past. We develop ways of avoiding these vulnerable emotions, and anger is one way of doing that. So, when someone looks at you in a certain way, or says something, you'd rather be angry than feel powerless, or unimportant (or whatever your kryptonite feeling is). In that moment, your instinct is to blame whatever happened, no matter how small, because that's the thing that happened just before you got mad. You fail to recognise that the problem is not the look on that person's face, or the shoe that someone left in front of the door...it's that you can't stand feeling something and you want to avoid it like you want to stamp your foot out if it's on fire.I suggest finding a therapist to work with. You can learn to take responsibility for your old emotions and find new ways to manage them. :)","Sounds like you're having a very real internal experience, and it sounds like you're aware of how your anger can ruin your mood and you are able to recognize that it's the anger itself that is causing the pain in your chest. This seems to be an insight into your anger and helps you understand that it is not the anger itself that is causing the pain, but something that you are carrying within yourself, which the anger is consuming. I would feel very sympathetic to you if you found it helpful to explore the root of that anger, and the more you could have any insight about the source of that anger, the better for you. I would also recommend that you start a journal, which would help you to write down the situation where you had your anger flare up. That would give you a greater understanding of the situation, and help you to explore the root of that anger."
"I constantly feel like everyone is up against me and trying their best to shut me down. It's ruining my mood and even my whole self. I have trouble sleeping, and I keep having sleep paralysis while dreaming of others mocking and judging me.","The problem you describe sounds very wearing on your spirit.Are there particular reasons for why you feel everyone hates you?Have you been in a clash of ideas or opinions and feel yourself in the minority viewpoint?Or does your sense of being shut out start within your own mind, as though you anticipate that others will not like what you say?If actual conversations are leading you to feel left out, then evaluate whether to bring up certain points to the other person.Or, you may also decide that the relationships in which you feel shut out, are no longer worthwhile ones for you.If the problem is hesitating to interact because you imagine others will reject you, then maybe you can coach yourself into trying a small step toward introducing yourself and your thoughts to others.",Hey there! It sounds like you are really having a hard time. What has happened in your life that has led to this feeling? What would you like to change in your life? Who has been most supportive in your life? Have you tried talking about how you feel? Would you like to learn what to do now to change things?
"I'm going through some things with my feelings and myself. I barely sleep and I do nothing but think about how I'm worthless and how I shouldn't be here.
   I've never tried or contemplated suicide. I've always wanted to fix my issues, but I never get around to it.
   How can I change my feeling of being worthless to everyone?","Hello, and thank you for your question and seeking advice on this. Feelings of worthlessness is unfortunately common. In fact, most people, if not all, have felt this to some degree at some point in their life. You are not alone. Changing our feelings is like changing our thoughts - it's hard to do. Our minds are so amazing that the minute you change your thought another one can be right there to take it's place. Without your permission, another thought can just pop in there. The new thought may feel worse than the last one! My guess is that you have tried several things to improve this on your own even before reaching out on here. People often try thinking positive thoughts, debating with their thoughts, or simply telling themselves that they need to ""snap out of it"" - which is also a thought that carries some self-criticism. Some people try a different approach, and there are counselors out there that can help you with this. The idea is that instead of trying to change the thoughts, you change how you respond to them. You learn skills that allow you to manage difficult thoughts and feelings differently so they don't have the same impact on you that they do right now. For some people, they actually DO begin to experience less hurtful thoughts once they learn how to manage the ones they have differently. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy may be a good choice for you. There is information online and even self-help books that you can use to teach you the skills that I mentioned. Because they are skills, they require practice, but many people have found great relief and an enriched life by learning them. As for suicidal thoughts, I am very glad to read that this has not happened to you. Still, you should watch out for this because it can be a sign of a worsening depression. If you begin to think about this, it is important to reach out to a support system right away. The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. The text line is #741741. I hope some other colleagues will provide you more suggestions. Be well...Robin Landwehr, DBH, LPCC","What I found helpful when I was on my own was to take things back by writing things down. What are the things that make you feel worthless or unwanted? Then write them all down! It's amazing how quickly you realize the amount of things going on that you want to change. Also, if you feel like you're going to do something bad or that's you that will cause a lot of pain to others, then write it down for once. I don't know what you would say to be helpful to those in your life, but those in your personal life, especially the closest ones, usually don't mean anything or understand what you are going through."
I have always wanted to have a transition from male to female for some time now. This issue has persisted for 10 years already but I don't know where to start. I do not have the soundest information either.,Wonderful!  I am so excited for you.  What a huge decision.  I am writing from Toronto Canada so it is hard for me to direct you specifically.  I would start with two things 1) Find a doctor that is comfortable perscribing hormones and 2) find a Counsellor or Therapist that is transgender specialized.  They will know how transitioning works in your health care system and other supports as well.  Google is a wonderful way to find these resources.   I wish you well. Thanks for writing!,"Hello!! It is wonderful to hear that you've always wanted to transition!! All of us have felt like we were being told what we should do by someone else at some point. That is what a therapist is here for so we can do it our own way. If we're 10 years old and talking about transitioning now? In that case, it might be important to talk to a parent or trusted family member so that they can understand what you are wanting. What are you planning to do at the same time? What are the risks? What are the benefits? I strongly suggest reading all of the information to make sure you are informed. If you think you can use the transition with a therapist, then we can start talking about this so that we can move on in the right direction."
"I think i may suffer from depression, and it is affecting my life and sleep. I am on my parent's insurance, and they won't let me see a therapist because they don't believe in it.","The answer here really depends upon your age and something called the ""age of consent"" in the state where you live. In Pennsylvania, anyone over the age of 14 can provide consent for their own treatment. As for billing purposes, try talking to some local agencies. If you are under 18, you may be able to have Medicaid out of medical necessity so that you can have treatment. If you are over 18, there may be some discounted rates at some agencies because of the situation you're in. Maybe your primary care physician will be able to refer you to some local agencies.If you are in school, you may be able to talk with a guidance counselor or someone at the school. This would not require using your insurance.","If your parents don't believe in it they may see it as something to not do in their life.If this is the case, then you can also say something about how it affects your life.  The thing is that the more we know about depression, the better we understand what depression is all about.  Depression doesn't always feel like sadness, and that's because depression affects all of our feelings, not just sadness.It's often a deep weariness within a body.  It's more than just sadness, because we get the sense that nothing will work.  This can also include fatigue, and an inability to work, or even not enjoy activities, even activities we normally would.  These are also things that are often associated with depression, but it can be other things, too. If it has been happening for more than a year, you should seek medical help.  The doctor can check if there is something else that is going on in your body that is affecting your life.   Many times, there is something else that's going on that's causing your depression to grow, so the doctor can help you find out what it is, to help you learn how to get over it.  Sometimes, depression is a response to other problems in life, such as having children, or losing a job, or dealing with a difficult relationship.  The way to tackle it is all about taking a break, so you do not feel overwhelmed.  It’s one of the most important things that you can do to feel better.  If it is in order to be more comfortable, your parents are likely to find it hard to agree to you going to the doctor, so they may not agree to let you go to therapy.  If that is the case, you need to make an agreement with them.  Maybe they can agree to go to therapy with you to be your support.  A good therapist and a parent are a perfect pairing.  You can also ask your parents whether they would like you to go to a doctor, or a therapist.  Whatever decision they make, just be sure you and your friends are making it together.  The doctor will make you feel better.  The therapist will help you get over the depression.  You don’t have to see the therapist alone.  The doctor is a good friend."
"My boyfriend is always saying he's done with me and says he's leaving, but then at the end of the night, he's still here. He wakes up in the morning, acts like nothing happen, and repeats this every night.","Do the two of you ever talk over why he does this or your reaction to it?Are you asking your question because his behavior upsets you or only out of curiosity to understand him better?Basically, first know your own reason for your question.   Then go ahead and tell him if what he does bothers you.  In the best of cases, he doesn't realize how his actions affect you and he will change.","I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this.There's not enough to say for me, as a robot, so I can't understand that there's really a difference of opinion with your boyfriend.A lot of people can feel confused between two people, and some people prefer more and some like the other person's opinion more. The important difference is that your boyfriend needs to tell you and acknowledge that his feelings about not wanting to be in a relationship anymore is not as healthy as he seems to be to tell you and acknowledge that.It sounds like there is more to figure out than just you and your boyfriend could.I suggest you reach out to friends, family, or another adult that you trust so that they have some ideas and to give you encouragement.The advice I'm going to give you is:There is no right or wrong way to resolve these kind of problems.You both need to get a feel for the others perspective.There are some things you can do to help with resolving this situation like talk to your boyfriend about how you feel.You can also talk with some friends or family members and ask them for advice, and support.It is also important to remember that these kind of emotions are normal and can be dealt with through love, understanding, and communication.I'm not asking for a psychologist to help you.There are some therapists and counselors that may want to talk to you about this.You can look for one through the internet.It's up to you whether or not to contact a therapist or counselor."
"I'm a Christian teenage girl, and I have lost my virginity. My boyfriend is a Christian teenager too, but things just got out of hand between us in a sexual manner. I planned to abstain from sex but I guess I wasn't clear about this because I was also tempted and led him on. We continued to have sex. Does it mean that he isn't the one God planned for me? We're so young, but that doesn't stop me from dreaming of a potential future together. I really do feel like he is in my life for an important reason. I'm incredibly happy for I was able to escape from several abusive relationships because of him. I love him very much.","Having sex with your boyfriend is and was a mistake. Mistakes can be forgiven and you can make amends.But it is not the end of your relationship or God's will for you.Have a serious talk with your guy and get back on track with where you want to be. Talk to a counselor or your priest/pastor. Get someone to be your guide and mentor. Check in with them regularly.Getting back to square one could actually strengthen your relationship.Have a plan for the future where you will not be put into a place of temptation. Group dates, public places and no alone time where temptations might arise.Forgive yourself and move on.","""It would be interesting to have a conversation with the church where you grew up with the people who would have been happy to see you. Perhaps some time in their 20s is the best time for a conversation. I am curious to know if your boyfriend has ever been to church or not. I'm also curious to know if he has ever been to your church. Sometimes, people can have very different beliefs, and sometimes that's okay. In others, things can get heated in their own way, and those ideas are not allowed to turn into something bigger. I can tell you whether or not he knows about things like baptism or the forgiveness of sins.  I hope you and your boyfriend have a lot of fun. If you would love to find out what these people think and do about your situation, consider talking with your parents before having a long conversation with them. Let them know that you have your own mind, and let your parents know that you’re in that moment, as a young girl who is trying to discover her true self."
"They don't go away, and I feel like I'm going crazy. Does that ever stop? Can it be a symptom of medication?","Since you realize that hearing voices in your head is not usual for you, then definitely there is a problematic situation happening within your awareness of who you are.if you recently started taking a new drug or increased dosage of one you already were taking, and the voices started shortly after, then yes, it is possible medication created your problem.Start by telling whoever gave you the presecription, about the problem you're having.""Crazy"" has some flexibility as to whether someone is this way or not.Certainly a very positive sign that you're not crazy, is that you're self-aware of a problem within yourself. And, you're responsible toward yourself and making effort to address this problem.Crazy people usually don't do responsible behaviors.","Hi there, your question is good to me, because right now you've got the question but not the answer. The best way to go around and help you is by understanding your question, then being the sort of guide that gives you the tools you need to get there. I don't know you or you know yourself. The question is asking you to learn more about something and your feeling about your question. A lot of times, it's not about your question, it's about what's behind it. The same things happens with medication - and I really believe that if people are using medication for problems that aren't really there, they are putting themselves in the wrong shoes and expecting a change. Sometimes, medication helps to bring something to light that is hidden. When you don't understand what's behind your question, how can you deal with it. Don't get yourself in trouble by trying to find answers in the wrong place."
"My dad doesn't like the fact that I'm a boy. He yells at me daily because of it and he tells me I'm extreme and over dramatic.
   I get so depressed because of my dad's yelling. He keeps asking me why I can't just be happy the way I am and yells at me on a daily basis. Is this considered emotional abuse?","Maybe this is emotional abuse.It certainly is irritating and annoying to be yelled at for being yourself.Maybe at a time when he's not yelling you can bring up the topic of your own willingness, if this is true, to discuss questions he has about your gender.There's no guarantee he won't start yelling midway through a dialogue like this.  Only then you will be on firm ground to excuse yourself from the conversation since you already explained that you're willing to talk with him and not to be yelled at by him.",Hi there.  I'm glad you found your therapist.  The first thing you need to do is ask yourself if you are able to see it from your father's perspective as well as yours.  He does not hate you; he has his own way of seeing you which I imagine does not align with what you believe.  Perhaps he also has his own issues.  What is most important is you feel safe enough to reach out for your feelings and then seek support. The way that you are coping now with his yelling may not be the best way for you to deal with it. I would recommend for you to talk to your therapist about this.I hope I provide helpful information.
"I know someone who is extremely sensitive to stress and very sensitive to a negative tone of voice. Sometimes during a disagreement he tells me that my communication is having a harmful impact on him. Once he believes I am being negative I can't seem to find a better way of communicating. In fact, it is often a self fulling prophesy because his accusatory manner becomes unbearably frustrating.    What advice might you offer?","With any type of criticism, it is usually best to introduce the topic at a neutral time, ie: when both of you are relaxed, with no current stressors involved, having fun, etc.  Begin with a non-judgmental reflective comment about a recent bothersome event, as if it were just then crossing your mind (therefore not something you've been consumed with ruminating over - eases the impulse for him to dive straight into defense mode).Then share how you felt at the time of the event.  Just say when.... I felt kind of hurt / shocked (or whatever the feeling was).  PERIOD.  THATS ALL YOU SHOULD SAY.  Wait for him to respond to your matter-of-fact statement.No matter what his response is, stick to your same message - don't get overwhelmed by trying to rephrase or explain your view as that will likely set you up for continued arguing.  You can even add, ""I agree I could have misunderstood  it (event).... I just know it made me feel uneasy.""Here you give him little wiggle room for a debate.Good luck & I'd love to hear how it goes!","As a therapist, I am glad you are willing to have these conversations in your relationship. The fact that you are willing to ask for help for your relationship is a sign of strength in this part of life. Both of you would benefit from this in the future. Here are some tips for a healthy conversation with an abusive partner: 
1. The fact that he expresses his feelings as if you have wronged him is very red flag. If you'd like to learn more about these behaviors and ways to deal with them in your relationship, you may consider seeing a mental health professional.
2. If you are thinking about a relationship where you would be able to have a healthy and respectful conversation, there are some questions you might find helpful:
   * Are you sure of yourself? 
   * Are you willing to listen to understand? 
   * Would you feel comfortable asking for help and get support? 
   * Can you see yourself being respectful of a partner who is different than you? 
   * Is there a way for us to improve our communication? 
In addition to the advice given above, if your partner is telling you, ""your tone of voice is hurting me"" or ""I'm not comfortable with you saying..."" Then you may want to consider asking for a timeout. The first few minutes of your dialogue is time for a break when your partner is not around. This way, you can focus on communicating your thoughts and feelings without your partner being disturbed.
3. Remember, there are a lot of people that care about you. It would be a shame if the person in your relationship was not the one who cared about you the most. If you would not have a healthy and respectful relationship with this person in the long term, it would be a shame to have that person be there in your life and not have that person in it."
"My dad beat and mentally abused me so badly that I can't function properly. Letting go of the past is important to moving on and getting better, but I’m terrified to get better because I don't even know who I am without the trauma. I've never gotten to be myself. I don't even know who I am.",I am so sorry to hear that you are struggling.  Getting to know yourself after a trauma (especially at the hands of a caregiver) and learning to trust yourself can feel terrifying.  I would encourage you to seek out a trauma therapist who can work with you slowly and at your pace.  You are not your trauma.  You are good and you are whole.  Please seek out the support of a therapist who sees that in you.,"Sometimes, it is helpful to talk with a therapist about what you're experiencing and how you're dealing with your trauma. You may also think of this as a way to seek support for some of the problems you're dealing with today. I can help you find some professional support in your area, as well as help you find people who can help you with your other issues."
I was violently raped by another women who was my friend of 13 years. I’m having bad flashbacks. I’m scared to sleep because I see it in my dreams. I don't leave the house because I have panic attacks.,"I'm sorry for your suffering.There are therapy programs which help people to gradually feel more at ease so that daily living does not feel so frightening.Once you feel stronger and more secure from such a behavioral program, you'll be able to sleep more peacefully and leave the house whenever necessary to do your regular life.Then, you will be able to open and clear the deep emotional hurt that always occurs from being violated by a trusted friend.Sending good wishes in your work!","Your friends may be in fear of violence, you should seek professional support as you have two experiences of violent behavior within 13 years with your friend. There is also the potential for some sort of abuse or violent relationship pattern within the friendship to occur. You are left with much trauma and anxiety in your life."
I have dog obsession disorder and I am having problems with my girlfriend because I am placing more importance to my two dogs over her. How do I get over this problem and prioritize my girlfriend over my two dogs?,"Hey, dogs are cool. They adore pleasing humans and often LOVE to work on learning what you want and expect from them. Your girlfriend on the other hand, likely has her own desires and needs that she attend to before tuning into yours. You are good with dogs, that tells me that you've spent some time observing their behavior. The first step in working through this issue would be similar, start to tune into and observe your girlfriend more often... Observation is a skill when it comes to relationship building. The skills you have mastered in relating with your dogs can carry over, you will just have to relearn what behaviors you are watching. And keep in mind that also means observing yourself in relationships.","As a fellow dog lover, I'm going to put on my therapist hat for you.  The fact that you're being honest with yourself about the issue shows me you're ready to work on it. First, you are doing you good in trying to have a meaningful relationship with your girlfriend. But, you can't just sit there with this issue without talking to her. Your love for two dogs is very clear and it does make sense that you are prioritizing them above her. How about you give her a chance to have some space too? The most important advice I can give you is to be honest with her and tell her about your love for her and your dogs. Tell her that you're concerned about how much you have been prioritizing the dogs at your expense. Try to talk about this with respect to being honest but also respectful of her feelings. Maybe she's struggling with something too and you can work with that, as well. In all seriousness, don't stop loving your dogs. They are important to you. But don't let them dictate your actions.  Your girlfriend deserves your time and attention."
"Whenever I have to speak in public or be in big crowds, I freak out. I get light-headed, sweaty, and I have trouble breathing.","Basically, your response is the fight, flight or freeze reaction
which is hard wired into the human nervous system, specifically, the autonomic nervous system (called the autonomic response).  This system
is responsible for regulating the heart, digestion, respiratory rate
as well as other aspects which match the symptoms you describe.  It is largely an unconscious function, but
with training it can be managed such as a public speaking course in which you
prepare and even have some exposure to smaller experiences to help you prepare
and cope for larger presentations.  One of the greatest applications of
addressing this response is the NASA program which exposes the astronauts to situations
they will encounter while in space which will trigger the response so that when
it does happen (not if but when) that they are able to move through the
challenge with success.  You can learn
more about his by going to TED Talks “What I learned about going blind in space” It is
a truly inspiring look at what you are experiencing as well as how to deal with
it. 
With that being said, finding a program
like a Dale Carnegie Public Speaking program can help.  Working with a counselor who can help you
utilize visualization of an upcoming speech has been shown to help and you can
always talk to your doctor to see what options might be available there as
well. Good luck!","So you know what you'd like to be comfortable with. As your thoughts are racing you can start to get to the idea that you probably have a few options. First, if you're still in the comfort zone, consider trying to practice some relaxation exercises. I'd recommend starting by slowly moving your body through a few stretches that you can do while sitting, and moving through a few slow, deep breaths, that will make you feel even less like you're running to escape the fear of public speaking. If those exercise are not helpful, consider other things such as talking to a therapist. There are therapists who specialize in anxiety and other issues, and they will know the best method for you."
"When I get around a particular person or when I go home, I'm just sad or irritated. The feeling comes and goes all day every day. I don't know what wrong. I'm not sure if I'm just making up symptoms and problems in my head or if there is something actually wrong.","Feelings are real, is very unlikely that you are making them up since they are a response to the thoughts in your mind and your daily experiences and interactions. Often we assume that feeling sadness is bad and that we should only feel happiness and joy; but all feelings have a purpose: joy, sadness, anger, frustration, excitement, anxiety, among others.   Is not healthy to experience the same feeling for a long time, so we should learn to identify what causes them and how to process them so you can navigate through life experiences with more ease.

No sé qué está mal.  No estoy seguro si estoy inventando los síntomas y problemas en mi cabeza o si algo realmente está mal. Los sentimientos son muy reales, y es muy poco probable que los estés inventando, por que los sentimientos son una respuesta tanto a los pensamientos que hay en nuestra cabeza, y, a las situaciones que nos ocurren día a día.  Muchas veces pensamos que sentirnos triste está mal, y que solo debemos sentirnos alegres, pero todas las emociones tienen un propósito y razón de ser, tanto la alegría, como la tristeza, el coraje, la frustración, la excitación o el desespero, entre otros.  No es bueno quedarnos estancados una emoción.  Así que es importante aprender a identificar que causa nuestros sentimientos, como procesarlos para poder superar nuestras emociones y movernos de una experiencia a otra con más tranquilidad.

Sometimes things that don't cause problems in the moment are in the background of the person you are interacting with. When you go home, you likely feel a part of you are unhappy. When you are alone the negative thoughts can happen as well, as you have time to reflect on your day.  The most important thing is to make sure that when you are in the moment to keep a good track of what you're thinking and feeling.  You can be able to notice if your mind is going to focus on negative thoughts and what those thoughts are telling you,  and if you can consciously turn your attention to a positive and positive thinking.  If you do this consistently, then you will also start to notice your body going into a natural state of calm and relaxation when you are alone. It's a very good idea to listen to your body and when it tells you to rest, then rest."
"As a child, my parents injured my brother, so they went to prison. I was there when he had gotten hurt, but I can't seem to remember. I also can't remember being with them quite well. It's a blur.","It's important to know that there are counselors who are trained in working with survivors of trauma and you can get help.  The ""blur"" in your memories is your brain's attempt to protect you from the experiences in your past.  To recover them can be a slow process done by a trained professional that you trust.  When you are ready and feel safe, those memories can be recovered and can be integrated with other memories.  This will help to lessen the potency of the memory, help to make sense of what has happened, and allow you to begin the healing process.  Check into therapist who are trained in EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing).","It sounds like some of what you're describing of this time in your life is an attachment issue. When parents are the first people you are turning to for comfort, and they are not there, you will struggle to form secure attachments with new people, which often leads to feeling confused about how to make yourself feel. When you have your parents go to prison, it may have also been a time that was highly emotional for you. You may have felt angry at your parents for this, or perhaps scared of your parents. As such, you're likely that your sense of self and relationships developed after this time. You may be feeling a sense of responsibility for whatever happened between your parents, and even though there may not be, there may be a part of you that is trying to do the right thing, and feel like you have no control over the situation. Your family didn't have healthy habits. It may be very difficult for you to connect with your parents as a family unit, as it is not a healthy or normal family. Learning how to manage and work through difficult family relationships may be a slow process of understanding the history between your family and the events that occurred between your parents."
I hate everything I see in the mirror. I don't like being in pictures and always scribble out my face. It's stressing me out. I don't trust my parents enough to tell them and I don't know what to do.,"This is so very common in this crazy looks-obsessed world! I meet so many beautiful people who can't see their beauty. Is there something getting in the way for you? Was there a time in your life when people teased you or told you something hurtful, or did something to you that made you feel ugly? If so, this can be addressed first. Sometimes stories are told about us when we're young and the best thing we can do is see the author's evil or careless intent and not take that on. A therapist can help you with this part.Once you've addressed any past barriers to feeling confident, you can focus on a few simple things. First, your thoughts. If you keep telling yourself that you don't like what you see, then you will never feel okay about your looks. Experiment with telling yourself something different. Look in the mirror and I dare you to find something that's lovely about your face. Focus on that. Describe what you see? If you were your own best friend, what would you say about your face? Eliminating those negative scripts and building new positive ones will help you feel more accepting of how you look. You can't change your face, but you can change your attitude towards your face. Confidence is the things that will make you beautiful!Accepting how you look is important. Without going to plastic surgery (the popularity of which is a testimony to how nuts this whole thing has become), you were born with that nose, those eyes, those lips. Accepting yourself and knowing it won't change is a good idea, because wishing it were different won't make it so!Looking good is also about minimizing flaws and building on your assets. Are you in a rut about hairstyle or makeup? Ask a good friend to give you a make-over. Play with your features and wardrobe. There are plenty of average looking people who know how to make themselves shine because they are creative!",""" I have been learning a lot about people like you. If you can feel that way about someone and you think they would like to know you, then you are at least looking at them from a place that isn't of fear.  You can say something to your parents if you have to, say, ""I don't like the way I see myself in the mirror sometimes."" Your parents might think you want to look like someone else in the mirror or they may not even care about what you think of your appearance.  If you are in love with someone and you are worried that they don't love you the way you love them, and you fear they will come to realise the depth of your love, then ask them what they feel about you. A really good answer is often a ""Yes"", and ""I do love you"", without a lengthy explanation of *why*.  If they don't feel that way they may just see you as another person and have no reason to feel differently, but this will only cause problems in the future.  However, if they do love you, the key thing is for you to let that be known.  Now you just need to find ways to make them aware of it."
"I was hanging out with my close guy friend. We started kissing, but afterwards, he said that we should just stay friends because he doesn't want to ruin anything. We both just got out of relationships. His was very sexual. I'm not a sexual person, and he knows that. I want to be with him, but I'm not ready for another relationship, and I don't know if he ever will want to be more than friends.","Given that both you and your friend recently ended your respective romantic relationships, kissing each other sounds like each of you satisfied a very natural need which for right now does not has a natural source of satisfaction.Suddenly being without a partner is difficult because a relationship absorbs and offers much of a person's energy. Stay focused on what you know about yourself, which is that you're not ready for another relationship.From what you describe about your friend, similar to you, he does not feel ready for a new relationship.If and when you feel ready to enter a new relationship and your friend seems attractive, then you'll be in a position to find out, either by approaching your friend as a potential partner, or by asking your question of his interest in you.Who knows?It is possible your friend will feel ready for a new relationship, approach you, and depending on your personal wishes to be or not be with who he has become, accept his offer.Good luck with Step One, becoming familiar with your new state of single hood, and sorting through the good news and bad news of your most recent relationship.","I do not believe that you are obligated to stay with him because you have said that you don’t feel ready for another relationship. You will need to find a partner who you feel is ready to have a relationship with you as well. He may not be, but there are lots of people out there waiting to be contacted. You can be single for a while and still be happy to be with your best friend. I know this is difficult for some people, and that you probably don't want the thought of ending your friendship with him. I hope this helps!"
"My mother has quite severe, undiagnosed OCD, diagnosed posttraumatic stress disorder, and maybe other mental health issues. She is weeks away from moving in with me, my husband, and our three children. I love my mother, but once she gets within her own area, she begins to tape all cracks and crevasses. She cannot tolerate any smells.","One way to handle the situation is to develop willingness to tolerate her unusual habits.  Would you be willing to talk with your kids that grandma is sensitive to smells and her way to address this is to tape up cracks and crevasses?As long as her behavior isn't aggressive, harmful to anyone, unethical or immoral, and you'd like her to live with you, then someone both sides need to be happy with the living condition.Also, if you haven't already done so, negotiate with your mom that the common family areas are off limits to taping the the cracks.  As part of adjusting to living with your family it is reasonable to expect she respect common areas and to limit her taping habit to her private sections within the house.Approach the matter fairly and with the expectation to satisfy all the people who are affected.","I understand you are in grief, guilt and regret, and possibly experiencing a loss or some other kind of loss associated with your mother's decision and ability to cope with it. I am sorry she is feeling this way.   The good news is you're also in grief over your own mom. Your mother will not be around when you have the time or the energy to say goodbye and how much you miss her.   The guilt may be coming from your own thoughts about her not being able to cope, perhaps a misguided belief you might have in her ability to cope or a worry about her hurting you or being hurt by you.   I hear in the text how your mother has been treating herself for her anxiety, depression, OCD, PTSD, and other mental health issues, and whether she needs any types of treatment or therapy. What she may be able to do is go and see another therapist and talk about these mental health issues, perhaps you'll be able to talk with her about her own treatment plans or find some support for them to help her."
I am in my 30s with 2 kids and no job and I'm behind on the bills. I've been trying everything with no results. I feel like everyone else puts their needs in front on mine. I give intil it hurts and I'm afraid that I'm going to fail my babies    I've been struggling for 5 yrs in a relationship with no communication and no alone time. How can I get some support?,"Financial stability is probably a good place to start your new life project.If your partner doesn't work or doesn't contribute his money to the household bills, then maybe you are eligible  for some type of stipend from the government.Especially since you have kids the child welfare service may intervene to help you.  Sometimes too, a partner who is unwilling to pay for their kids' wellbeing may be pressured by child welfare to make regular contributions to you and your kids.I''m glad you are thinking of your needs and those of your kids.  This is the philosophy which will show you what road to follow so all three of you are in a secure financial place.","A good question for many people is ""How do I get support from my partner? Most people just don't know how to ask for it"", but it's true what the word says! Having a partner that is willing to listen to you can be the difference in the health of your relationship.  Your partner may not know how to be supportive, but you might not know how to show your partner support as well. How about you offer to go to couples' counseling where you learn about each other better and how to communicate more effectively? You may be surprised at how well your spouse knows you in a very personal way and how much you can both communicate. If a counselor can't help your relationship, then consider getting some guidance from a therapist."
"I'm an adult, facing problems with my mom. She's way too controlling. She decides things for me, disregarding whatever I say. I tried explaining my side to her calmly, but she eventually gets angry and doesn't wish to listen to me regardless of how I speak to her.","The part of your life which is in your control is the way you handle what your mom does and the way she talks to you.It is possible the two of you have very different opinions on a great number of matters.Each person, including you, has the right to decide whether and how to respond to someone.Stick up for your own right to make decisions.If she doesn't accept your independent viewpoints, then this doesn't give away your right to have these views.Since she makes herself clear as to her unwillingness to listen to you, then consider this as an easy way to avoid directly speaking with her about what's on your mind.If she ever shows an interest in your opinions and you feel like discussing these with her, then feel free to make this choice.","How about that time you were in kindergarten and your mom told you to wear a blue shirt for the school play, even though you felt you would fit it. How do you think your mom was able to get your parents to do what she wanted?"
"She's busy because her mom makes her clean all the time and go out places with her family. We don't talk much because of it. Also, we have little fights. We want to work it out but we don't know how.","Maybe you can start with having 15 minutes per week that you know you will be spending time with each other (even if it needs to be on the phone). Because this much time could be scheduled ahead of time, at least you would know there was that time that was set aside. That may also help you to rekindle some conversations between you.As far as your little fights, consider spending five minutes with one of you talking about one issue that is a concern and the other partner asking questions that are open-ended (cannot be answered with just yes or no) and listening as an investigative reporter to try to learn more about what the other person is experiencing. Then, once the partner who started speaking thinks the listening partner is understanding where they are coming from, switch. It's also good to restate what you think you are hearing. Then you know what each other is truly following about this. Also remember that following or understanding what someone is saying does not imply agreement, just that you are recognizing what they are saying and able to see where they are coming from.Also consider noticing what makes you feel valued, special, loved, or appreciated. Think of the same for your girlfriend. This could be a great discussion to have as well.","If we can get a little more clarity regarding your goals for the relationship, we would have some ideas of what steps we could take to change the dynamics within that relationship.I wish her well in her efforts to get help. I hope it helps her see how far she has come. I am here for her to help her feel loved. I wish you the best in your work here!"
How do I stop those thoughts?,"The thoughts you are having are just thoughts.  Not actions.  It is your choice whether you act on these thoughts.  If you decide to explore having sex with adults of different genders that is great.  If you find yourself obsessed with sexual thoughts, you may want to see a cognitive-behavioural therapist.  Take care.","I can’t tell you how to stop those thoughts. Thoughts are just thoughts.Thoughts can come and go.  I can offer you a few basic questions that can help to assess whether you're thinking about something that is helpful. In general, I have thought that thoughts are just thoughts.  In other words, when we tell ourselves, 'I am so stupid!' or 'I'm going to fail at this', it is a problem of how we are thinking about the situation and this has nothing to do with how smart or capable we actually are.  The problem, usually, is when we have what we call 'negative thoughts', those are those thoughts that are a little bit depressing and sad and that are filled with self-criticism.  The big question we have to ask ourselves is that if we were talking to a friend about this, that would our friend say, 'Oh, you are being so negative!'   The answer to that question is a resounding yes!  That is your friend's view of you and not the truth.    So, maybe, just maybe, you should start to wonder if you are indeed saying what you would say to a good friend?  And if you were going to say that to your friend, what is the truth about you that would be helping you out?  It is only when you take this question and ask yourself a series of questions, that we begin to ask more clear and targeted questions to solve our thought issues.    That's usually a good way to work through those negative thoughts!�������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������������"
"My fiancée suffers from severe anxiety and depression. She has had it most of her life. Her anxiety in public places is the worst. It gets to points where she can't breathe or move. Sometimes, she won't even go to the restroom, so she will hold in her pee until her stomach hurts or she pees herself. She curls up in corners at the mall and has panic attacks. She won't eat or drink in public. If she isn't having a panic attack or crying, she's clinging to me and avoiding everything and everyone. Her depression flares up out of nowhere and causes her to become very suicidal and self-harming. She get really sick from anxiety and scared to the point that I can't even get her to eat, drink, leave the bed, or go outside. She always tells me how she grew up around so much fighting and fear that it makes her scared of loud sounds, yelling, conflict, and even talking to strangers in public. She will refuse to go to a store unless I am with her to talk to the cashier for her. She is so scared that I can't even get her to drive. She doesn't want to get her license because she's scared of trying to drive.
   Some people have recommended medication, but I believe it's just going to cover up her illness and not solve it. I don't want my fiancée pumped with drugs. I believe a psychiatric service dog would be the best bet for her. When we first met my poodle, it would calm her down a lot. She took the dog out every time we went out, and she seemed much calmer and happier. She slowly would eat, and the dog seemed to make her feel a lot better. I am worried and want to help her without medication.","It sounds like you have been a positive support for your fiancee. There is no doubt that this situation is a great challenge for the both of you. While it may feel like you are responsible for her health and happiness, it is important that you understand that you, on your own, won't be able to resolve her mental health issues. Based on what you have explained, it sounds like she needs to get a medical and/or psychiatric evaluation. Whether or not she decides to take medication is her (and your) decision, but keeping an open mind about treatment options is important. I suggest that she see a therapist on her own in order to better understand and cope with her anxiety and depression, especially given her suicidal thoughts. You would also likely benefit from therapy, individual or couple's therapy, in order to address how you are feeling and best learn how to support her and your relationship. I wish the very best for both of you and hope that things will improve sooner than later.","Your client wants to help her fiance fight her depression by having a psychiatric service dog and talking to someone about medical and psychiatric options. You said that medication does not really solve the problem, but one of the mental health and health-psychology professionals advise. I would recommend talking to a medical professional and someone that knows both mental health and behavioral psychology. This is really important so you can find the best plan for your clients.     And most importantly, you could also talk to any friends or family members that you know that work in this field. You could ask for a consultation with a mental health professional and get feedback from someone in the field about the best way to work with your fiance."
"I panicked over a minor parking lot mistake. It was totally my fault, but due to another insurance issue, I left a note with an illegible phone number. Guilty over this, I got an envelope containing several hundred dollars. Unfortunately, by the time I returned, the other driver had seen my ersatz note and drove away. Since I cannot make this up to that individual, how do I atone for my cowardly act? I have been trying to do random acts of kindness in hopes that karma will somehow even out.","From your writing, you have already atoned for what you describe as ""cowardly"".Recognizing your action and trying to directly correct it, realizing your action was improper and demonstrating the willingness to take right action, are all examples of making things right.Since the actual driver is unavailable to consult as to their wishes on what they expect and feel would correct the matter, you did the next best thing and considered the situation from the driver point of view.",It's understandable to feel remorse for your actions and to consider forgiveness if possible. In some cultures it's considered bad luck to seek forgiveness. If you're in a place where seeking forgiveness is frowned upon then you might consider how to express or apologize to that person with more than one means. It may be wise to make amends with a different way of making amends so other people don't feel threatened by this act of cowardice.
"I stress over everything. If I don't have enough ""quality time"" with my boyfriend, I start to feel resentment towards him. He has three children, and they are great kids, but I find we don't have much time together. I break down easily and find myself depressed.","Everyone has some level of anxiety - it's what helps us respond to stressors in our lives and clues us into the fact that we need to respond to something going on. However, if you're feeling overwhelmed by racing thoughts, feeling like you spend a lot of energy worrying about something specific or even pretty much anything at all, and you're starting to find that it's getting in your way when it comes to living your life the way you want, then I'd suggest seeing a counselor or therapist for an assessment for anxiety. Your other concerns, though, seem pretty ""normal"" for someone who is in a relationship with a partner who has children. As a married stepmother, I've been there, and as a therapist, I can tell you that the boundaries and communication skills you have in your relationships need to be healthy for you to feel healthy. Finding some support from a group of others whose partners have children might be really helpful - being able to hear from others that you aren't alone in feeling like this can really lighten the load, and they might have some good ideas for handling certain situations. Another option is to find a counselor or therapist who has experience working with step/blended family dynamics - because even if you're not officially married, those dynamics come into play whenever there are kids from another relationship involved. You may even consider couples counseling so that both of you can learn to talk about your relationship needs and concerns in a way that will encourage connection and strengthen your sense of partnership.","Your feelings are valid.  It seems like you are experiencing some difficult emotions about your lack of time with your boyfriend.  You may not be sure what you are asking for, but what you feel will help you to know where you stand.  A good plan would be to check-in with your boyfriend. You may also want to consider what you like about your relationship with him.  How often are you able to spend quality time together.  Are your dates at home, but doing something nice for him.  Are you able to have a date night, where you spend the entire evening together?    This may be the first step towards finding solutions to your frustrations and your feelings of resentment.  Good luck, finding a way to stay connected!"
What makes a healthy marriage last?,"This is a fantastic question. In one sentence, I would say the following:Recognize that while you and your partner probably have common interests and areas of commonality, you are separate people, each with different wants, wishes, and desires – if you consider a diagram of two overlapping circles, they may share perhaps a third of the circle with overlap to indicate commonality (could be more or less) and then there are parts of the circles that are not overlapping, indicating separate interestsAs for ways that may strengthen any relationship, even the great ones, this is what came to mind. There are certainly more specific unique answers or elements for different people as far as the details, but here are some general ideas:Try to have at least 15 minutes a week where you are spending time together and not problem-solvingRealize that listening to your partner does not mean that you are agreeing with them, it just means that you are saying that you hear where they are coming fromLearn to hold on to your own wants, wishes, and desires while also recognizing those of your partnerSet boundaries for what is and isn't acceptable behavior during an argument or difficult discussionDiscuss how having important discussions can be anxiety-producing and consider having an understanding that if one of you (or both of you) feels overwhelmed, you can take a timeout for a certain amount of time. For example, you may say ""okay, I'm feeling really stressed about this right now. Let's discuss it in an hour."" And at that time, go back to the discussionConsider what your partner's top three or four complaints about you may be. Check in with them and see how accurate you are. If you see validity in their responses, consider whether or not you may want to make changesDiscover what makes your partner feel loved, valued, appreciated, or specialRelationships are always in progress and constantly changing. Some anxiety around change is typical. Being able to effectively discuss the anxiety and actually listen to one another without being defensive, name calling, finger-pointing, or asking each other to change is a true gift.You may enjoy this quote: ""Connection is the energy that is created between people when they feel seen, heard, and valued; when they can give and receive without judgment."" ~Brene Brown","This is a big question, and one that many couples grapple with! It seems like your partner is asking a fair amount of questions. A great question to keep asking yourself: What are the best behaviors? 

It is really hard to define these behaviors because they depend so much on the personalities of the different people in the relationship. However, to start with, good communication is the most critical behavior in the marriage. It’s easy to forget about this, but good communication is the foundation for a happy and healthy marriage.  Talk about anything that is bothering you at all, and you will quickly be able to see how your relationship has been affected negatively.  Another important behavior is respecting each other.  Respect the time that your spouse spends at work or other extracurricular activities, even if you feel they are not a good time to be in the same room. Respecting someone's differences and how they like to talk about what they do or don't like is something that is worth celebrating.  In addition, the ability to compromise and work together to solve the problems of the relationship is another important behavior.  Good communication and teamwork will allow both people in the relationship to thrive, not survive, in their relationships."
"Now that the other girl is out of the picture, our sex life isn't the same. Is it because he is still thinking about the other girl?",Or...better yet... Is it you still thinking about the other girl?  I am sure his cheating hurt you emotionally and may have affected your sexual performance as well.  Make sure the other girl is out the picture on your end as well.  Sounds like something the both of you need to have a calm and adult conversation about.,It may also be as you've noticed the difference in your sex life is due to a shift in your dynamics and intimacy. This shift may be because of new experiences that have changed your relationship or your sexual relationship.
I feel like my time is going too fast,"Thank you for reaching out! That is a great question! As an American, I can truly say that I spend way too much time on the go! It is a proven fact that Americans live in a fast paced environment compared to Europe! I often ask myself, what if I only had one day left on this Earth? What would I do? Well, that is an easy question. I would spend it with my family! Easier said than done when we are living in a tomorrow kind of World, right? Its hard to focus on the now when we are so consumed in what tomorrow shall bring.Time management is a very important factor when learning to ""live life to the fullest""! In fact, this is a required course in undergraduate college now. Everyone manages their time differently and it is up to you to decide how you would like to do this. Personally, for myself I like to keep a calendar with a to-do list. I always place my most important tasks at the top of the list. That way, if I do not get through the list, I am not stressing over the little things. When planning your day, it is important you schedule work, eat and play. A much as it is hard not to work after getting off work, it must be done. There is discipline involved in this process. If you have trouble with this, then maybe seeking out some accountability such as including a coworker to make sure you do not bring work home once your shift is over or your spouse/partner reminding you that this is a time for play and not work.These are just some ideas that I am throwing out there. Again, everyone has their own style on time management. I hope this was helpful for you. Please don't hesitate to reach out for anything further!","Feeling like your time is going too fast is really a common and totally valid response to the way we live in modern times, where our lives get filled with screens and tasks to do, we get more and more anxious about whether enough time we have to accomplish all that we think we need to. This anxiety is definitely one of the main issues that many people in today's world experience when looking at the amount of time they have on their hands.  The good news is that this feeling can also be positive. As long as you recognize that feeling that you will soon have enough time on your hands, this helps you to realize that this is a good time to spend your time. The problem is that this feeling isn't always positive and the main problem is not your time. This is about how you spend your time. In this case, you are able to use your time productively for different reasons that are good and help you to focus on things in your life that you enjoy and feel good about."
"I’m in a relationship with my child's father. I’m a really jealous person. We don’t go out or do anything with other people because of me. To keep our relationship going, I know I have to stop being jealous, but I can’t. How can I get over these issues?","It may be important to look at this as getting through something rather than ""getting over it."" If you're aware of the reasons why you are jealous, I don't know if they relate to this relationship or a previous one, but you could remind yourself of the differences if your feelings of jealousy relate to something from your past.Also, it may be beneficial to have a conversation with your child's father if you are both open to having a discussion about this in a way that you summarize what each other is saying so you are sure that you are understanding each other, at least to some degree.Also, consider what you may want from your child's father to assist you with this. You cannot make him do anything to support you with this, but you can certainly ask.What is something you could start or stop doing to move you toward your goal?","Sometimes this jealousy is due to a feeling of lack in yourself. How does it feel when others seem to have what you always wanted? If you are never satisfied or never happy, jealousy comes from not wanting to be any less than you are. Also, the people of today are very popular and seem to want our attention, which we may not be wanting in return. If you want to stay in a good relationship with your child’s father, I would suggest you work towards understanding your feelings and why you are feeling jealous. And if you are unable to do that, then maybe you need to work on a very firm boundary with him."
"My daughter was overly tired and throwing a fit at her grandparent's house. She wanted to come home at midnight and cried screamed said she said she hated her grandma and that she wanted to kill herself!
    We also have a new baby in the house i didn't know if this would contribute to this. How should I approach this?","You wrote a very full family context w many directions to examine.Do you know or can you find out what the grandma and your daughter were doing in the evening of the screaming episode?Is it possible the grandma abuses your daughter, or tells her scary stories, watches scary movies.  These are only suggestions of some problem between grandma and your daughter.Also, ask your daughter directly why she wants to kill herself and what' killing herself"" means.   Seven year olds don't have a concept of death being a forever condition.  Seven year olds don't have a sense of future meaning besides liking/disliking them.   Maybe the new baby is a factor.  Do you feel this is a factor?   Trust your intuition to tell you if your daughter is resentful of your new baby.Even if she is, I doubt a seven year old has the capacity to connect current unhappiness with the intention of a future action, including suicide.","Please note that this is not a substitute for professional therapy. In any therapy sessions, it is important to take a good look at your own reactions, emotions, and feelings, and how they may be influencing your understanding of what you are experiencing. The level of stress and anxiety may be higher than normal. It may also be helpful to talk with your daughter or grandchild about how you are feeling. You may need to seek help from mental health professionals or other therapists that may be able to help you with your concerns."
"I don't know how to have emotions. I never had any from my birth. Being human, I think of myself as a monster. I enjoy pain. I cut myself for my climax during sex. I think most of the time, I lie, even when sometimes it would have been easy just to tell the truth. I was in rehabilitation for four year. I have made love with both men and women, but it made no impact in my emotions. The books that I enjoy reading H.P. Lovecraft and Edgar Allen Poe. I go hunting every Saturday. I feel powerful. I don't enjoy the killing of the creature, but the hunt of it and to eat and drink the flesh and blood of the creature.","I'm not sure that you don't feel emotion or that you are frightened of the depth of your emotions. From what you write, the context of your growing up years had people telling you to not feel.  Little kids and babies don't remember whether or not they had emotions since birth.  This is information someone told you or was part of your family system.Possibly your family was afraid of their emotions or of you knowing yours.Similarly, your comparison of being human means being monster like, is not an obvious connection.  Besides, monsters are an idea, they aren't real.  They embody what someone considers the worst qualities of themselves or the human species.  Again, I wonder whether you've taken on stories you heard growing up about how unacceptable and bad you are.A way to start learning your emotions is to start in simple, basic ways to ask yourself what you are feeling in the situations that you believe emotions would belong.If on the first bright sunny and warm day of the year, you remind yourself to notice what you're feeling in response to this, you'll be taking one step toward awareness of your emotions.If someone buys you a birthday present, be aware of how you feel.  Keep adding awareness to situations and see if this builds an ease with feeling emotions.","Hi, I'm sorry to hear that your parents are not being supportive of your relationship of love for yourself. I do not know the reasons for your parents' response to your life and how to improve things. If you wish to try communicating your thoughts, as you described in the original question I don’t think this would be in the best interest of your parents. I don’t want to make the assumption, though that it's common for parents to not support their children. You want the help and guidance of your father, but that may not be an appropriate environment to do so.  You have an opportunity to talk with your parent in a clear and compassionate manner.  If you are successful, you may be able to discuss with your parents why you need the help and support they are giving you, and to find other ways to address the emotional pain you may be experiencing.  It's possible that your parents have good reasons for how they are helping you, for example, they may believe that it would be bad for your family.  I'm not sure what the reasons may be and I don't want to talk about the details, or what I would say if I was able to.  If you're able to talk to your parents I will also recommend that you have a discussion with them, and to discuss what I have already read about yourself and to discuss how I can help you. If you and your parents are able to find a way to communicate with each other, and even better, have you and your parents get help (such as a therapist)  to help your family, you will be able to find better support for your life."
"He's been losing feelings and he doesn't know why. I love him very very much. He sometimes thinks I'm obsessed when I'm not at all. I give him his space and I make sure he's okay but sometimes I think if me and him saw each other more it would be better? I truly want me and him to get better, it's kind of hard not to stress about it, because the love of my life is losing feelings which is a sad feeling. He's a great guy! I just don't know why he's been losing feelings towards me. He's starting to put less effort in talking to me. At this point I'll do anything to just make us better as a couple. I tried talking to him but he doesn't like talking about it much. Advice on what to do?","I'm willing to bet that this isn't what you are hoping to hear, but I'd suggest giving him space. Ooph, that's a tough one, right?! I know. But here's the thing, when you keep trying to process and talk it out with him you keep pushing him away. He needs to feel like a solid and whole person (as you do too) to be able to be fully in your relationship. It's the work of being in relationship to learn this. I get that this is tough stuff. I wonder, outside of being with him, how do you soothe and calm yourself? That's the stuff for you to tune into and focus on right now.","What can you learn if you are asking him more about his feelings? When people feel vulnerable, it's natural to feel insecure about the relationship.  If you are not trying to find the reason for this change and instead just asking questions you could learn how he feels and the other way around. You might be surprised by the answers. If he doesn't want to talk about it and feels shame and embarrassment and that he is alone, there might be a reason why he's no longer trying to have that conversation. You could ask him what he is afraid about. As your husband, he's probably not just trying to be better on his own. You might want to ask him what he thinks he could do to make things better."
"My boyfriend won't touch me intimately, he won't kiss me while we are having sex and he won't have oral sex with me. I know he has done this things with other women in the past. I don't know why he won't do them with me. What should I do?","First off, don't blame yourself or be too quick to jump to any scary conclusions.  Human sexuality can be incredibly complex at times (e.g., what turns us on at one time may not be what turns us on the next time). There could actually be a number of things going on including him having performance anxiety...maybe he had a bad experience with a previous partner that's left him scared to try again (we call this operant conditioning).  It could also be that he puts you in a different category than previous lovers.  Sometimes I refer to this as the ""hooker-housewife mentality"" where a partner somehow gets the idea that when we truly fall in love, we treat that one differently; almost up on a pedestal.  Drives many partners crazy until they're aware that this is going on and give their boyfriend/ girlfriend permission to enjoy both the naughty and the nice with them. It could also be that he's not even aware that he's not doing these things. If you haven't asked him yet, you might try gently approaching the subject when you're not already in the bedroom or trying to get in on and inquire what he most enjoys about sex with you (or has enjoyed in the past, or thinks he might enjoy).  You can also share your favorite highlights of sex with him.  Give him an ego boost and tell him what he does well while then asking him if he'd be down to go downtown.  ""Baby, it REALLY turns me on when you kiss me during sex.""If you continue to get the impression that it's somehow only about YOU or that he's just really hesitant to talk about sex in general, you might see if he'd be cool to chat with a counselor who specializes in sexual intimacy.","The answer is you know more than that. All this is fine and that is what matters. A therapist would not tell you what to do based on your relationship. The man won't touch you intimate, which is fine, but that's not the only thing. If he doesn't touch you in a way that's enjoyable for you, what about other things? If this is important to you, this is something to take into consideration. Talking to your boyfriend about this (in private) might be useful. I would recommend finding another way to talk to him. Maybe you can ask him to go to therapy so he can work on this and also so you both have your own way of enjoying intimacy."
Sometimes 3 times a night.,"Perhaps more dreaming means that you are making use of your mind to solve problems.  I find that change states, while sometimes difficult, are very exciting.  They give you opportunity to grow more rapidly.  So I say: ""congratulations!""  ~Mark (www.MarkMorrisLCSW.com and www.LivingYes.org)",My answer will take time to answer as I work with the issue at hand. I may need help from other individuals to find my answer as I cannot be sure of the cause of my issues.
I shake and have panic attacks.,"One way to understand panic attacks is as a sign of feeling insecure or lacking confidence in a certain area or characteristic of yourself.The insecurity can sometimes feel overwhelming and this starts the sense of panic. One way to build your sense of security within yourself is to have a simple life and a slow paced life.   When there are many activities or involvements to pay attention, then it is easy to not give full attention to all of them.  This may trigger a sense of insecurity since in fact you may not have had sufficient time to study and know your own opinion about all of what your life is immersed in.A simpler life of fewer activities allows more time to know and understand your own inner feelings and reactions.To know more about yourself may help build your confidence and security in your ability to know and live what goes on in your life!","I think you might want to consider talking to your GP about a test to see if your panic attacks are related to some kind of underlying medical issues. Some people with anxiety and/or panic disorder have symptoms that are not clear-cut and include abnormal heart rhythm that can lead to panic attacks. They often have physical symptoms that they attribute to the ""anxiety"" and they get treatment and are successful.Sometimes, the medication for your anxiety is actually helping to control the panic attacks you have!"
"My boyfriend and I have a toxic relationship due to his emotional and verbal abuse but he makes me feel like I could never find someone better, and that I can't be happy without him.
   How do I get away from this relationship?","I'm glad you recognize your own best interest and that your life will be much better without verbal and emotional abuse.One of the terrible results of being abused in a relationship which is expected to be loving, safe and supportive, is that the one who is being abused, starts to question their own judgement, rights, opinions, overall way of thinking.This happens because partners who are intimately involved with one another are very meaningful.  Regardless of how irrational, wrong, mean, selfish, intimidating, thoughtless, a partner is to the other, the person on the receiving side gradually starts questioning whether they are wrong for not accepting these sorts of interactions.Stick with what your own intuition tells you.There is a part within each of us which knows the truth of what is going on.Leaving a relationship is always difficult to some degree.  People are in familiar patterns of daily behavior, no one wants to suddenly ""be alone"", even if this only means showing up as a physical body, not as a truly loving partner, no one wants to start telling others about a breakup, answer questions about it, feel blamed, worry what others think.These are secondary matters to following the truth in your own heart.Listen to yourself about leaving this guy. Your inner self does not lie to you.","To answer this question, you would need to consider what he says and does to make you feel this way. If his behavior is abusive by definition, then you may be better off seeing a therapist in order to see what he is truly thinking and feeling.  Here are some additional suggestions. It is also important to note if you aren't ready to leave your boyfriend, then this may be a very difficult process. If you want to try to leave while he is not around, it's important that you do a financial background check, and know your resources so you know what to look for.  If you know your boyfriend is abusive and there is a danger to yourself, there is often a domestic violence hotline that you can call.   You can find help with a quick call at 1-800-799-SAFE or by going to https://www.thehotline.org.   If you are considering an immediate escape, you may want to speak with a therapist for guidance.   I want to emphasize, however, that leaving may be a difficult process. I want to also add that what you experience in your relationship may be in a different way than what you expect it to be. If you're unsure, you can speak with a counselor that will come in and examine whether you are experiencing trauma."
"My husband and I had our first threesome recently. Everyone was drinking and he was on her more then me.    He and I talked about it afterwards and it made me feel better, and now I'm craving more of it. But before it gets close to happening I get this empty feeling. Why am I feeling this way?","As someone who specializes in sexuality and polyamory, I can tell you that your experience is incredibly common. It can be helpful to keep in mind that alcohol lowers our inhibitions, and for first time threesomes or any new sexual behavior really, we humans tend to enjoy a little extra oomph to our courage levels. That being said, it also lowers our ability to make well thought-out decisions. This combined with the brain rewarding novelty (new lover, new experience with our partner etc.) and maybe even some over-zealousness and performance anxiety could likely explain why your husband was on her more than you. My encouragement to you is to try not to overthink it at this stage. Now, IF you two choose to bring her or someone else into the bedroom again and a similar thing keeps happening, I would definitely push the issue and see what's up from his perspective.The empty feeling could be any number of things including:Fear that ""you're not enough for him""Fear that ""she's better than you"" in some wayFear that ""if we keep doing this thing, he will need it and what happens if I no longer want it?""Opposite fear of ""what if I now want her more than him"" or ""if I want the threesomes and he doesn't?""Fear of ""does this mean our sex life isn't good enough as it is?""....""do we have to always add a little spice to keep it hot?""Or like Robin alluded to, preconceived notions about what culture, religion, family and friends etc. say about what marriage and sex ""should"" look like.  I also agree with her encouragement to explore the empty feeling further and see what nuances of other feelings are in there...jealousy? insecurity? shame? regret? longing?  When you can identify and name them, they are easier handled. Some of the resources I recommend poly/ sexually open couples are:“Love in Abundance: a Counselor’s Advice on Open Relationships” by Kathy Labriola“The Jealousy Workbook: Exercises and Insights for Managing Open Relationships” by Kathy Labriola“Rewriting the Rules: an Integrative Guide to Love, Sex, and Relationships” by Meg Barker“More Than Two: a Practical Guide to Ethical Polyamory” by Franklin Veaux & Eve Rickert“The Game Changer: a Memoir of Disruptive Love” by Franklin Veaux“The Ethical Slut: a Practical Guide to Polyamory, Open Relationships, and Other Adventures” by Dossie Easton & Janet Hardy“Opening Up: a Guide to Creating and Sustaining Open Relationships” by Tristan Taormino“Open All the Way: Confessions From my Open Marriage” by Sadie Smythe“Henry and June: From ‘A Journal of Love’ – The Unexpurgated Diary of Anais Nin (1931-1932)“Personally, I find your cravings to be healthy and quite normal. The key is to make them work well for you and your partner(s). Robin's also right about communication being key. Some of the suggested resources above can help get those conversations started. And if you need further assistance, absolutely I would find a sex-positive, poly-positive counselor to chat with.Best of luck to you!Tamara Powell, LMHC","It sounds like you feel like you miss something important and that you are missing out on something. The most obvious answer is that you need more of your partner as well as your individual pleasure. Your pleasure is important, but not in the same way it is for your partner. Also, you say that you feel empty, meaning there is something missing and you feel like you have already given everything.  One thing that might help is to think about what it feels like for your partner to be happy and relaxed, and what you think you would give to make him happy and relaxed. Maybe you are feeling less connected to your partner because you are waiting for him to satisfy your need. That's what you'd want him to do. If the answer is no, then you need to consider other potential answers. Since your pleasure comes from other sources, then you will need to find other sources of pleasure to satisfy the need. I recommend exploring the concept of relational joy. It will come from connecting with other people who love and enjoy you as much as you love them."
"I never feel like myself. I can’t even think straight anymore. I start stuttering and I can’t remember anything. I always get nervous and usually talk myself down but recently end up fighting with, what feels like, someone else. I don’t know why I feel this way, but I hate it.","Hi Houston, Okay, something's definitely going on, right? My gut is to start with your family physician, because you have some physical symptoms. While it seems anxiety is a likely problem here, your doctor will hopefully know your history and can help you decide if you need some medical tests or some therapy. Without knowing more, that's all I can say at this point. Best of luck.","I understand. At first, people who have trouble with their thoughts often feel like they do not know who they are. They have no idea why they stutter or why they have a hard time remembering. However, there are things that you can do at home to get your thoughts more clear and help you to remember what you have done. There are also things you can do to find a way to live a more satisfying life for yourself. The fact that you have found out that you do not know is a good thing, because you are at the beginning of a life and are able to change it. If you can figure out why you stutter and why you have trouble remembering, you will find a way to help with that. I know that at first, it may not make sense, but please see a professional psychologist or mental health professional so that they can help you with any of these difficulties."
"The sounds of eating and breathing gives me headaches—mostly mouth breathing and snoring. It makes me angry, and I want to solve it myself.","Probably good to know in what type of situations you are, in which you are hearing mouth breathing and snoring.If you're sleeping beside your partner who does these actions, would have a different response than if you overhear mouth breathing and snoring from a family member who is napping on the couch and you are walking past them on your way to take a snack in the kitchen.Basically, if the person who does these actions which bother you, start by telling them.Depending on whether they are empathetic to how distressed you are from their sounds, or not, willing to change, or not, has a good deal to do with next steps.I don't really see any step you're able to take to solve that you are sensitive to human sounds from the head.One path I don't recommend is expecting yourself to ignore the fact of being feeling bothered, or dismissing your own sensitivity someone.Your needs matter.","I hope you can find this source of relief and understand what is going on with you. You mentioned that you were angry, which is not something to be proud of. Often, it can be seen as a way of trying to feel better or to have the feelings of anger out and away. In the early stages of the disorder with your symptoms, you may try to stop by the ""solution"". Often, as anger is out of control, it is very important that you understand the root cause of it. It's most likely that there is an anger-related disorder, such as a disorder with obsessive compulsive behaviors. What I want you to know is that it is okay to ask for help. If you can, look up information on anger disorders. There is a lot of information on disorders related to anger, in which individuals have an expression that can be considered obsessive compulsive. If you find you are struggling to manage your anger, or to keep it under control, a therapist can help."
"A girl and I were madly in love. We dated for over a year and were even talking about marriage and future plans together. She moved away for school, and we attempted a long distance relationship. We eventually broke up. It's been a year now, and I still haven't lost my feelings for her. I still love her the same way I did. I've suffered from depression ever since the breakup and have been unable to connect with anyone else. It's damaging me and my life.","Hi Boise, I'm sorry that you've lost this love. The fact that you were planning marriage and a future tells me that you meant something very special to each other at that time. It's different now...you're not together anymore, but you can't accept this, right? Good for you for identifying that this situation is damaging your life. You've been grieving for longer than you were together. Oh, but really you've not been grieving...you're stuck still loving her instead of moving forward. Unrequited love is a recipe for eternal heartache. Let's look at some possible blocks to moving forward.It could be that there's something unfinished for you. Maybe you felt hurt and you didn't have the chance to say so, or you felt you hurt her and you didn't have the chance to make it right. Maybe there's a burning question you need to ask or something else you need to say. Maybe you want to tell her you've never stopped loving her, and see if she feels the same way. If this is the case, you have two choices, right? You can reach out and say what you need to say, or you can stop ruminating on that question and let it go. If you reach out, there's no guarantee it will go well or that she'll even respond. Maybe write her a letter and don't send it (or send it...it might be worth the risk). Use the next paragraph to help you decide. Do you know how she feels? How did it end? Did she end it? Was it ended just because of the distance, or are there more differences between you that didn't work? Sometimes people are so in love that they can't clearly see that the other person isn't in love with them anymore. Use the information you have about what she wants for her life...can you honour what she says she needs? If she's asked for distance, you would do well to honour that.A key to moving forward: look at your thoughts and where they're getting stuck. Write it down. What bad thing can happen if you let it go? Or ""If I move forward, that will mean...""  Keep going...what would be the worst part of that?  This kind of exploring can help you identify your stuck place.It is possible that you've turned this ending into some kind of negative meaning about you or your future. As in ""If this person doesn't love me, then I'm unlovable"", or ""No one will ever love me as much as she did"". So your need to cling to her in your heart is your way of rejecting that negative message about yourself or the future. Can you find another way to reject that message? Try saying these things to yourself:I know she loved me. There is evidence of that.I was a good partner. There is evidence of that.It's part of life to fall in love and then have to move forward...I can do this and learn from it.Many people like me...that's how I know I'm lovable.It's normal to feel sad. I'm grieving a lost love.I want to move forward and not stare in the rearview mirror.I know more love awaits me if I can get fear out of the way.If this person loved me, others can too, (but not if I'm clinging to some old memory)These are the kinds of things a therapist would explore with you. I wish you well!","It sounds like you know what you want so, and so you don't know why you don't feel that desire to have her back. What you're having with those feelings of intense longing is not unusual, even in those that have been through breakups or relationships. It is normal to have these intense feelings to a degree in our lives. There are many reasons that the breakup could be causing you to have feelings such as longing. It is possible that you are still hurt with the loss of the relationship. It is also possible that you are still in love and missing that connection. You have been depressed and sad since the breakup and it is possible that those feelings have been tied to your depression. If the depression has been the cause of your sadness and longing it sounds like the depression is causing you to struggle in every way possible, and to have what you are now feeling - which is longing, sadness, and depression - they are a pattern of the depression to be able to cope better with the world and life.  It sounds like you do not know how to work through the hurt, or that you have been hurt to such a degree that you have really let go of your ability to cope. It sounds like you have been lonely in a way that has had some negative effects on your life.  It is good that you're asking questions about how to cope. And it sounds like you're open to the fact that you could be doing better in your life.  If you decide to talk with a doctor, that could help you discover ways to deal with the effects of depression and what to do to help with your grief. If it helps you to feel more connected with the world, consider joining a support group. There are lots of new people, so it is possible that you will meet people who understand your experience. You may also be able to take a class or attend a public event.    You may want to find someone who matches your interests, like a hobby, or a sport, that you can enjoy doing. It sounds like you could get more out of life by finding new ways to be engaged with the world."
"I met the first man five months ago. I have come a long way and do have feelings for him. I know he would do anything for me and my kids. The man I love is their father, and no matter how many times things haven't been great in the past, I can't help but love him. I know they both love me, and I love both of them.","The answer depends entirely on which interest is stronger for you.If the reliable caretaker man is not someone with whom you'd have fun, lively conversations, understand each other, be sexually compatible, or romantically attracted, and your primary interest is in someone who' steadily manage the kids, household, and finances, then he is the right one for you!The problem is you may not be happy longterm with someone to whom you feel no romantic compatibility. Consider the drawback if you reach the moment of restlessness romantically and are with someone on whom you depend to take care of your kids.Since you have feelings for him, then wait several months longer to see whether or not you can imagine yourself romantically happy with the steady guy.If the other guy who is also the bio dad, isn't involved with his own kids, then he seems like a poor choice of someone to be with longterm.",What is it about your love for that man?
"She constantly tells me what I am doing wrong. For once, I want her to be proud of me. It’s like no matter what I do, she does not have one nice word to say to me. She is always hateful towards me and always has been.","I imagine this is very difficult and confusing for you.It sounds like there are things for which you are proud of yourself, which is really good. I hope there are also other people in your life that are currently able to recognize the good things that you're doing.If you think your mom would be willing to go to see a local mental health professional with you, that may be a good place to have some discussions about the relationship that the two of you have. The reason I'm suggesting that it may be easier to have the conversations there is because sometimes the mental health professional can point out parts of conflict that are not easy for the people who are involved to actually see by themselves.If you want to try to talk with you mom to see how she is feeling, maybe she would be willing to discuss it with you. If you're going to have a conversation like that, I would suggest you try these things:Ask her if this would be a good time to have an important conversation. If she says no, consider asking her when would be a better time.Try to have the conversation with the goal of taking about five minutes to learn more about where she is coming from on this. If you can ask questions to learn more about that, you may be able to know more about what she is thinking and feeling.This doesn't mean that you have to agree with her, but just that you are able to hear where she is coming from.Try to ask questions that start with the words who, what, how, where, when. Questions that start with the word ""why"" can be difficult to answer and can lead to a lot of extra emotion.Try to summarize what she is saying to see if you have it right.If you want your mom to know how you feel, after you can listen to what she is saying and see if she is willing to listen to what you would like to say.If you're going to tell your mom about how you feel, consider having some points written down ahead of time so you can explain yourself the way that you want to.It will probably be really hard to listen to her without being defensive right away. I know I would be wanting to jump right into the conversation. Remember that jumping in right away will probably make it more difficult to learn where your mom is coming from.Also, if she says she doesn't want to have a conversation, remember that she has that choice.If your mom does not want to go to see a counselor with you, remember that you could go on your own. Depending on your state and exactly how old you are, you may need your parent's permission to be in treatment, but not always. If you need help to figure that out, try contacting a couple of local mental health agencies to see if they can help you figure out what to do if you want to talk to someone.","I hear that you hear a lot of this same dialogue. I hear it. When you start getting frustrated with how you're perceived by others, and what is perceived by others in our interactions, it is very normal to feel insecure, or even angry. I also hear you saying that she loves being a critic of your behavior and actions, which sounds frustrating. You may feel angry about being this way. She doesn't even know how much it's bothering you. I think there is a chance that she could show you you are worthy of love and respect, and she wants to get closer to that in the future. It sounds like she is having trouble in the conversation that you and you are having with her, which makes her very reactive. As for any feelings of not being worthy or deserving of love, I would encourage you to talk with a therapist about what this could mean.  There are lots of reasons why a child could learn this behavior and it's important that a parent understands the reasons why this occurs.   It’s likely some form of anxiety or insecurities. I would suggest that if that is what is happening with your wife, you look for one who respects your feelings and your boundaries.  Not all of the time will be easy, but you have to start with your own self-respect, and work on respecting your own and her own.   I would encourage you to explore why she acts this way so much.   Maybe she feels like she's not good enough, or that she needs more attention.   If that's what it is she is afraid of losing your attention.   As for you... I would suggest that if you have your own insecurities, and you don't feel worthy, then you need to work on fixing that in yourself first.   What is more important then being able to do what you want, or to actually feel worthy of what you want?   . It is important to remember this, and if you have other issues, that are not directly relating to your relationship with your wife, then consider speaking with a doctor and a therapist about it.   As you start to address your own fears and insecurities, a relationship with your wife will naturally become much easier and more enjoyable for you.   Good luck!"
"My doctor thinks that seeing a psychiatrist will help with my depression and anxiety. Now my anxiety is worse, what do I do? Writing on here has taken every bit of strength I have left.","Did you take the medication the way the psychiatrist prescribed it?  Did you follow up with her/him to report how it was going?  Different medications work differently with different people.   It's not always the first one that helps.  And some of the medications take some time to have an effect.  Give the doctor the chance to help you. I suggest you find a certified CBT therapist to help you examine your thinking.  www.AcademyofCT.org has listings of the finest CBT clinicians.  In the meantime, do some ""anxiety fasting"" by taking a few minutes to do something nice for yourself right now.  I hope you feel better soon.  ~Mark (www.MarkMorrisLCSW.com and www.LivingYes.org)","I noticed you wrote with lots of questions. Your questions are important because anxiety is often linked to trauma and that, this is where I, and many others, struggle to define boundaries with therapy. Because I have seen too much and in too many ways with trauma, I am usually quick to say that the only thing that will help is having a good therapist. So you are in an unhelpful cycle! Here are a few things that might help: 1) Talk to your doctor about more specialized treatment. 2) Find a therapist that you can trust to help you explore what's going on with your anxiety. 3) Listen to your body. Anxiety is physical. 4) Talk to a support group. 5) Take some time away from the books. 6) Find some hobbies! 7) Practice mindfulness."
"For the past four weeks, I've been having nightmares and hearing voices telling me of horrible things. They're not random voices, but rather, the voices of those I care about.","I would recommend that you talk with a mental health professional near you about the details so you can have some really specific support for what you are going through.I don't know if you can understand when the voices are saying, but I wonder how you feel about what you are hearing? If the voices are just at night, is it possible that they are part of a nightmare or a dream? If you recall your nightmares, consider writing them down so that you can remember their content and work with a mental health professional to look for patterns.One thing that may help you while you are awake is to try to stay connected to the room you're in. For example, take time to notice your feet on the floor, hips in the chair, and shoulders against the back of the chair. You can also try mindfulness techniques, such as noticing what is around you or changing your breathing patterns. These ideas may help in the meantime prior to having more specific ideas from someone near you.Thanks for reaching out!","This sounds really distressing, but also not very uncommon. It's a difficult experience, and it sounds like this has been hard for you in your daily life as well. There are several potential causes and what you need to consider. A doctor can run tests and get a referral to a specialist, but as far as I know there isn't a doctor that can just do this all for you.  As long as you understand all the reasons why you're hearing these voices in your sleep, you will be able to keep yourself safe and confident! If you're not feeling safe and confident, then you may need to find a way to stop yourself from hearing the voices and begin to help yourself find a coping mechanism to deal with these nightmares. In addition, there are many, many resources out there that might be helpful in this type of situation. If you are thinking of having a nightmare, I would suggest you try to have a friend or family member nearby who could help keep you safe. You are not alone in this, though."
She is living with her boyfriend of seven years. He is in therapy for depression and social anxiety. He hasn't worked in all this time.,"Congrats on your upcoming grandchild!Does your daughter want you to break news of her pregnancy, to the family?Talk with your daughter first, whether or not she would like you to tell other family members.Also, given the other facts you mention in your post, if household and financial management are areas you feel your daughter is vulnerable, then bring up these topics too.Stay open minded about your daughter having views which are different from yours.","This sounds like a healthy choice for your partner.I would feel bad for him as the person who has been through depression and social anxiety for seven years.I'm aware that for most people, if it's a depressive and anxiety disorder, it's more than worth the effort to work on it.I would like to know how long your girlfriend has been in therapy for depression and social anxiety.I believe that this person has also been through a lot of emotional trauma.I think she probably knows exactly how to move on with her life, as she is not afraid to live her life fully, with the benefit of being clear on what she wants and needs.I would like to be sure that your girlfriend is in a safe place, as it would be very easy for your boyfriend to throw you off, however your girlfriend has worked so hard in that place to gain her freedom and confidence.I think it's wise for your girlfriend to work with her boyfriend because there may be emotional issues that she is experiencing, like an inability to feel emotions, or issues with controlling behavior.These are a lot of things to consider so her therapist needs to keep you in mind as well.I think that your girlfriend has a lot to learn and this might feel scary at first but you want to help her to get into better gear."
My motivation has gone away. It's hard to get out of bed. I really don't know what to do anymore. I'm miserable. My anxiety and depression have taken over my life.,"Anxiety and Depression are challenging experiences to live with and to manage on a daily basis. I would say that both are challenges to overcome but solutions to living healthy and well exist. Step 1: Talk about it. With friends, family, partners, counselors, and other trusted people in your life. Step 2: Create a plan with a counselor to learn new skills that help you recognize and manage your symptoms. Step 3: Don't give up. Working on yourself can be difficult and hard at the beginning. Stick with it and you will be able to find exercises, tools, and resources that help you live well.","I heard it all when I was a child. My mother had depression, we didn't know it at first. I was so little when the feelings came on - they were a bit rough around the edges, even when I was only six. I wanted to be the big girl of the house and would try to make the best of the situation, but that just made it worse. I didn't think she cared that much about me at the time, or that what she was feeling was a sign of her being sick, so I wanted to make the best of what I had. But now, I am an older child/younger person and have realized that my mother didn't know where to start. I know that you have to do it on your own, and I know I have to do it too. So, how can we start? The first step is to understand how you feel. Are you feeling sad? Do you feel anxious? Are you feeling helpless? These questions may not be your only feelings, but they are some of the most important. Ask yourself whether you would be depressed or anxious if the situation were changed. You are not depressed or anxious unless you have this. Are you feeling better since you started doing things differently? How would it be different if you were really worried? When would you stop worrying? At what would you stop worrying? The more we talk to ourselves about how we feel and how things have changed in our lives, the more and more we can come to recognize what we might be feeling. The first step is always the hardest. So, maybe try going to someone that you feel good with and tell them what you're feeling. Do it to yourself."
What are the basic skills a good counselor needs to have?,"Here is a list of skills I use every session, and a short explanation of what they are:Reflecting: Paraphrasing what clients have said so that they know you understand themValidating: Helping clients to know that their point of view is valuable and rationalClient-centered talk: Maintaining focus on the client in therapy sessions, rather than a therapist talking about themselvesAttending: Nonverbal or verbal cues that indicate I am listening to a client (i.e., nodding, leaning in, affirmations)Reframing: Helping a client to see a problematic behavior or situation in a different way (usually only works well after they feel heard and understood)","That's a wonderful question. It's one that many people have asked and wondered, and I know that the answer isn't just a simple answer. It's a little bit complex, and is also really multifaceted. From my perspective as a counselor, there are a few basic skills that I find to be particularly helpful:

*   **Active Listening:** The ability to fully and honestly listen to what others say, understanding them is better than hearing about them. This doesn't just mean listening to words, but also trying to understand the emotions and context behind words.

*    **Empathy:** Seeing the world through another person's eyes, understanding why the person might feel a particular way and caring about their feelings.

*   **Empathy**: It is similar to the above. You aren't judging your other person's feelings or behaviours, but simply trying to understand them.   This is why it is crucial for the counseling to work.  If the person does not know what emotions they are experiencing they are very likely to be unsure of their own feelings and/or behaviour.  It is imperative that you are not looking for them to answer the question of how you feel. It's essential to be supportive and curious, not judgmental.                                                                                                                                                                    �"
"I'm a teenager, and while I’ve never been to any kind of therapist, I noticed I experience several anxiety symptoms. I frequently find myself not going out and following my parent around the house. I can't go into stores (grocery stores specifically) on my own, and when I do, I have to be on the phone with my dad the whole time. I also forget things a lot.","With the way you described your anxiety, it sounds like you have different types of anxiety. I'm not sure whether you have anxiety of public places, large crowds, being alone  (sometimes called separation anxiety), or some combination thereof.One thing that would be helpful would be to track your anxiety and see how anxious you are (on a scale of 1 to 10) in different situations. Also, if you know what leads up to your anxiety, it would be good to know this as well so you can look for patterns.As for forgetting things, you could be anxious because you are forgetting things or you could be forgetting things because you are anxious. When you are having anxiety, certain parts of your brain are overactive because you are in a kind of protective mode. It's also possible that forgetting things and anxiety are not related.Something else to try would be to notice where you feel your anxiety in your body and put your hand there is a way of giving yourself comfort.Another thing about anxiety is that having anxiety can lead to more worry about having more anxiety. One thing that helps for some people is to go to the regular primary care doctor to make sure that there are no physical problems (just for the regular physical) so they know that there are no physical problems and that the anxiety will lessen in a few minutes.Also, if you are able to notice your feet on the floor or your hips in the chair, this is helping you to be mindful of your body and connecting you to your surroundings. During this in combination with naming your emotions can be soothing as well. For example, in the grocery store, if you are feeling anxious, you could say to yourself ""I'm anxious right now and I'm okay"" while gently shifting your weight from one foot to the other. No one around you would notice what you were doing and the motion may be soothing to you.Anxiety can have a lot of different causes and things that trigger it. If it is difficult for you to work it out on your own (which is very common), consider talking with a local therapist so you can have more specific ideas.Also consider making a list of people who you trust and what it is about them that makes you feel comfortable.","It sounds like you are having a difficult time dealing with anxiety.  As an adult, the stress of figuring out where to go to purchase things or dealing with your family has caused you to be anxious. It sounds like you would benefit from a new way to deal with all this stress.You are dealing with feelings of frustration and helplessness in those situations. Perhaps learning some coping skills would provide you with a chance to learn better ways of facing these types of stress situations."
It's really hard to not have negative feelings about friends who don't put any effort into nourishing our relationship.,"One thing I would ask is ""why are you still hanging with those {friends}?"" A relationship needs to be nurtured by both parties, it is a dynamic fluctuation between two people. I would ask you to question why you continue to remain together as friends, I always believed that a relationship should emit positivity towards all parties involved, if your in a relationship that is one-sided, it is inevitable that it will start to de-compensate. Never travel with the circus, never travel with fools, everything in life should have some positive payout, will things at times be negative, of course they will, but in order to keep something or someone in your life there should be more positivity than negativity.Hope this helps, C","As much as friendship helps, it's helpful for us to do our own work at maintaining friendship.  In other words, friends of friends do not necessarily have a romantic/sexual interest in each other or anything similar.  If you are hoping your friends aren't so good at nurturing the friendship, there may be some issues at play. The best way to get a better idea of your friend's motivation for continuing to bother you, can start by simply asking them for an honest look at the friendship.  If you feel that they won't be open to helping you identify that you're struggling with the friendship, it may be more helpful to let it go."
"This is preventing me from getting a job. I have bad relationship with my bipolar mother. I am living with her but it stresses me out so much to be around her that I have locked myself in my room. I have no friends or other family to help me. I have no money for therapy, but I think I need therapy before I can secure a job.",A good first step would be to make an appointment with your primary care provider & discuss your concerns.  They would have resources available to help in your particular situation.,"Hi Mark, I'm not sure why I'm able to talk about all this but from what you described in your own words you've been in a really bad place that seems like an extended period of conflict with the family and there is a wide variety of reasons why this relationship could cause you this much stress, I wonder if by having a conversation with him about your worries you might find your own unique resolution or perhaps it will help him find his own resolution by being helpful with your stress and helping you create a life plan that includes you as a happy member of that family and perhaps the hope to meet someone who matches your values will give you more energy to live on. The best way to work this out is to find out yourself if the problem is with him or with yourself, there isn't a simple formula and hopefully you do know what that is. As for therapy, it could definitely be helpful. It is also worth keeping the peace between family, as well as being honest about your desire to live independently. I wonder if a good place to start would be to find out more about the family dynamic and if all that is a source of conflict and maybe a little too much pressure for you to take on by yourself."
"I am lazy. I am very aware of the problem and try to talk myself out of it all the time, but I never seem to shake the habits. I try to think of what it is doing to me and my future, but no matter what, I keep creating excuses for myself to continue the procrastination. All I'm ever left with is regrets and a low grade. I am at an all-time low in my life, and I'm not even that old. I've always been a straight-A student, but now I'm getting C's and F's, and it hurts me to know that I am way better than that. It's not even like the work is hard.","I am sorry to hear that you are going through such a tough time. It sounds to me like you are suffering from depression to some degree. Have you seen a therapist or talked to anyone about your problems? If not, I would advise that you do so sooner than later so that you can learn what is causing you to be unmotivated and causing difficulty with breaking the cycle that you are in. It is also a good idea to get a medical evaluation from your doctor to rule out any medical causes for your current condition. Most often, difficult situations that life throws at us, along with an inability to think positively, and break bad habits are what cause depression. Some things you can do immediately are seek help from a professional, schedule in time every day to engage in pleasurable (or once pleasurable) activities, exercise daily, and practice thinking more positively. Set a few daily goals for yourself and write them down each morning or the night before. Achieving your goals every day will give you a sense of accomplishment and can lead to feeling more optimistic and capable. Additionally, keep a journal to write down how you are feeling and what ideas you have to help feel better. Sometimes having these ideas written down make it more real and tangible. Know that depression is most often curable but takes work and a desire to change (which you clearly have). Once you start feeling better about yourself and your life, your grades should naturally begin to improve, as you will have more motivation and energy to focus on that particular area. Best of luck to you!","There's a lot you could be doing.  If you will just go to the top of your ""to do's"" list and check off just 10 things you could do each day for the next week.  And you may find that you want to do something different for the rest of the week!"
"Recently my boyfriend broke up with me because of my bad language. But he thinks I'm a total b***h. I know I'm bipolar and can be selfish. He called me today and says he can't go through with the breakup. I was broken and didn't want a breakup to begin with, but I know I'm horrible at times and can't help it. It's like I'm battling myself. What do you feel?","Both options seem reasonable.  Seeking individual therapy will help you to cope with the mood changes that come with bipolar disorder, will give you a space to vent your negative thoughts, and will allow you to find the coping mechanism to address life and relational challenges.  IF your boyfriend is interested in attending couples therapy with you, it will assist in identifying the problems in the relationship that pushed him to the breakup and will give both of you the tools to communicate and resolve conflicts.I am a Licensed Professional Counselor in Texas, currently providing individual, couples, and family therapy services in West Houston.  You may reach me at 787-466-5478 to schedule an appointment.    ¿Debería buscar ayuda yo sola o junto con mi novio?Mi novio me dejo recientemente por ser mal hablada.  El piensa que soy una p***a.  Yo sé que soy bipolar y que puedo ser egoísta.  El me llamo hoy para decirme que no puede continuar separado.  Yo estaba destruida y no quería que nos dejáramos desde el inicio, pero se lo horrible que puedo ser a veces y que no lo puedo evitar.  Es como si estuviera en guerra conmigo misma.  ¿Qué piensas?Ambas opciones son razonables.   Buscar terapia individual te ayudara a manejar los cambios de estado de ánimo que son partes del desorden bipolar, también te dará espacio para ventilar los pensamientos negativos y encontrar herramientas para enfrentar problemas relacionales y de la vida diaria.   SI tu novio está interesado, también pueden asistir a terapia de pareja para poder identificar las razones de la separación, y obtener las herramientas apropiadas para  comunicarse apropiadamente y resolver conflictos.

Not only that you don't understand how you feel as you are bipolar with many other things going on in your life, but that the fact that you are able to say it is your greatest strength!  You know that you aren't a problem and there is more to you in your life than what she thinks. Bipolar disorder is about your mind and not who you are or what you do. It is about having different moods and energy levels.  She did not understand that and she didn't have a good enough understand of yourself as well as she does of you. It's not your fault that she was hurt by you.  You have it hard enough being bipolar yourself; having to deal with it while also being in a relationship can be tough. The good news is that it is possible to stop getting trapped in an emotional cycle and work on your own life!  Not only can you figure out what your symptoms are but also determine what you're going to do about them.  It is what is going to make your life better, if that is what you desire."
"My girlfriend's grandma passed away 5 months ago. They were very close. She took care of her till she died. Things kinda returned to normal few weeks later. Last month it feels like we hit a brick wall. Intimacy fell off. I asked what's up. She says she can't connect with anyone and that it's not me. She used to be very open and expressive. Now she gives short answers and has no interest in sex or any touching. When we did have sex in the last month, something felt really off. Now I'm very insecure about us and have thoughts of her cheating. She says otherwise, but I don't know. It just feels like something is really off.","Grief has a huge impact on us and everyone's reaction is different. The one common reaction however is to shut down and distance ourselves. Her relationship with her grandmother was close, given she took care of her up until she passed. It sounds like she is working through a difficult loss and her ability to connect with you, or anyone else, is likely low right now. Trust what she is telling you and try to be there for her as she works through it. If she finds it too difficult to connect again, a good grief counselor can help her get back on track.","The situation you have in front of you may have several answers to who is the problem.

The most common answers are that this is your girlfriend’s problem. She has been isolated for five months and needs the help to move away from the pain of loss. In addition, it may be the husband's problem. One or both of them may have been hurt by the relationship that her girlfriend had with her grandmother. At one time, there may have been a lot of stress in the relationship with the grandmother or there may have been other issues that made this the right time for her to grow up. In addition, there may be a physical or mental health condition at play. A number of things can cause these types of issues in relationships.

Your girlfriend is able to communicate some things about what is going on but it may be too obvious for your to see. This is because the past may haunt her and she has been holding onto the pain and the things that are wrong in her life for a while. So while it may seem like nothing in your life is wrong, it may be that there are many things in your life that are off which could be creating a problem in your relationship. 

We don't know exactly what's going on, so that is difficult. There may not have been much time when you two were together when she was dying. Maybe that is part of what she is feeling for the right now and what happened in the past may haunt her and be getting in the way. A couple in general will sometimes have some of the same old patterns, but this may be an exception. There may be some things that have been going on for a very long time, that are now re-emerging. It may also be that the loss of the grandma is adding to other problems you two are facing. One thing is you can trust your girlfriend's intuition. She is telling you something that you may not be hearing right now."
"My son stole my debit card and lied about it. It's not the first time he has lied. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know if I should punish him or make him do something. I've tried talking to him and asking if anything was wrong. I have grounded him, but nothing works. What should I do?","Hi Enid, You sound like a sensitive parent; I like that you talked to your son to see if anything is wrong. There is some key information here (I don't know your son's age, whether he spent any money, whether he put the card back, or how many times he's stolen), and my answer might be different depending on those details, but I'll give you my thoughts.I see it as every child's job to figure out the rules and find where their power is in the world. In order to accomplish that, many of them test limits. ""What can I get away with?"" is a question they have to find the answer to. If a child knows the rules, they're much more likely to not test limits (because they already know the limits). So, part of testing limits is experimenting with stealing and lying. Not all kids steal, but I would say pretty much every child lies at some point. It's a normal behaviour, and most of the time it's about small things that don't matter and we don't even find out. Stealing a debit card is a bit more serious, and I'm not surprised he lied about it. If you absolutely know that he took it, it's okay to tell him that you believe he did this thing and also lied about it. It's appropriate to give a consequence for this type of behaviour, so that the child doesn't do it again. The consequence should be as natural and logical as possible. The behaviour (stealing) was harmful to you, so doing you a favour with extra chores might be a good idea. It's funny, because as parents we try to tell our kids that lying is bad, but they know they'll get a consequence if they tell the truth so there are natural deterrents to being honest (we don't want people to know our mistakes). It's a dilemma. If you really want to focus on the lying part, you can tell him that you won't give him a consequence for the lying if he decides to come clean with the truth within one day. That gives him incentive to come to you with truth. It sometimes works with kids to give them a chance to come clean and then reward them for telling the truth. You can set your child up for success and train them to tolerate honesty. Put a cookie on the counter. Tell your child to take the cookie at some point in the day. Then ask them later if they took the cookie. You're making honesty fun. Kids love games. Basically, there's as much power in rewarding the positive behaviour as punishing the negative. If this is the first serious offence for your son, don't make a big deal of it; consequence him and see if he learns. If it's a pattern, that's different and you may want the input of a therapist.","Your answer is the best you can do, as well as the most common."
"I am a teenage girl. I've been seeing the same dream once in a while since I was very young. The problem is that I don't remember anything about this dream. I still know that it's the same one, and then I wake up in a panic, and I cry really loud without knowing the reason. Why do I see the same dream, why can I not remember it, and what should I do to remember it?","There is no scientifically established formula for understanding dreams, that I know about, however, many people get a great deal of value from exploring what their dreams mean. It is believed by many that our dreams contain metaphors that represent meaningful patterns in our lives and relationships and if we pay attention to them we can learn important things about ourselves. One thing you might try, to see if you can get more insight into the dream and possibly begin remembering things, is to take note of whatever you do remember, any details about your experience, such as when do you wake up from the dream, how do you feel, both emotionally and physically, what are you thinking about when you wake up, is there any pattern in terms of what happens to you in your waking life around the time you have this dream... If you can keep a journal or a recording device to speak into by your bed, you can try to record whatever you do remember and notice as soon as you wake up. People seem to have more difficulty remembering dreams, the more time they let go by before attempting to record the dream, or if you go back to sleep before recording what you remember.","When a dream happens, it is often one of the few things we are able to look at and remember. To let the brain forget you can be a very difficult thing. There are several reasons for this, but when it comes to the cause of sleep dreaming, it is a complex and confusing issue. It is known as lucid dreaming, and the dream has been remembered by some to be about the current day. One common theory is that dreams are related to our subconscious, which is where we store our memories of the past, our desires, our wishes, and our fears. A dream is one of the few times we see our dreams, so it may be more important to think and work with the subconscious, particularly if you have had a stressful day. If you have experienced trauma, and your dream is happening in dreams related to your childhood or past, then you may have a lot of nightmares coming at you as you sleep and it may be better to talk to your parents of your therapist. As a result, you should be able to calm down with the right amount of sleep and maybe even think about what that dream means."
I've recently thought that i could be transgender but I've never had the mind of a girl.,"Hello Frostproof,Thinking about becoming transgender and being transgender are slightly different.  This is a topic that is best discussed with a therapist that specializes in LGBTQ issues.  From what you have written it sounds as if you still have some confusion as to where you fit in with the ""labeling system"".  While labels provide a means to quickly identify and classify, they can also feel restrictive or confining.  Instead of focusing on fitting into a specific classification, explore who you are as a person and celebrate your positive qualities and those things that make you uniquely you!  There are many options for you to find a therapist and e-therapy is also an option.  You can try Breakthrough an online service.   Here is some reading for refection that you may find helpful.  Yin Yang Woman Man http://dld.bz/ejVK2  What does it mean to be a woman or a man?","As this is an area of exploration, and you haven't explored your emotions and your sexual identity, I would suggest to talk with a therapist who specializes in transgender issues. You may also need to explore some of your emotions and desires to see where you're at in your life. This will take time and may not be helpful in the short term, but you are not alone. I hope that the people and communities that are out there for you will help. In the meantime, explore the feelings of desire that may or may not be related to the experiences you have. There's a lot of interest in how to transition and change gender roles that are beyond the scope of individual therapist sessions. Take care and be kind to yourself."
"Because we are on opposite coasts, we try to talk early mornings, but she is constantly interrupted by visitors. I suggested setting aside some time, but she has made it very clear she has no intention of changing her lifestyle. She is also drinking beer every day on antipsychotics.","The answer depends on how satisfied and happy you feel in being part of this friendship.From what you write, there aren't any statements as to what gives you happiness about being a friend to this person.Since you already made a request of. your friend and she isn't following through, you could ask if she is willing to work with your suggested plan.The friendship may take a new format, depending on your friend's response.Its possible to be in contact more spontaneously, when either of you feel like contacting the other.What matters most is your own dissatisfaction with the current relationship status.Even if you change to a, birthday and holiday only conversation, or some other style of interacting, at least it will be the result of the effort from each person, not just one, who is you, designing arrangements which only you are willing to keep.","As a therapist, it sounds like you need to understand what's causing the drinker to feel such a great deal of pressure from visitors. It is not an unreasonable idea to think that if the people that she is going to visit aren't here for her, then she has no desire to see those people. If the alcohol is causing her to feel such a great deal of pressure, it might be useful to talk with her about what you think she might be trying to accomplish by drinking beer. In order to not feel so pressured she may be able to develop better coping mechanisms for dealing with visitors.  I would suggest that we have a conversation about what would be better for her, because it sounds as though she needs help with finding coping mechanisms that work for her."
I suffer from checking and cleaning OCD. Can counseling help me to get over it?,"Counseling can be very effective for OCD. In particularly, a kind of therapy called Exposure Response (Ritual) Prevention Therapy is considered the 'gold standard' for the treatment of OCD. What this is, is a specific protocol that helps you build relaxation strategies and to increase the amount of time between your checking/cleaning rituals while also helping you to face any of the fears that OCD given you until those rituals and fears are no longer interfering with your life. Research has shown that this kind of therapy may even be more effective for OCD than medication, https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.162.1.151","This sounds like a significant and very real disturbance in your life. It seems like you are in distress of being overly preoccupied with cleaning and/or organizing. If you're taking more time and energy than you would like to spend to get this under control, then this can be very frustrating. If you take your OCD to the point where you cannot live a normal life, that may mean that you've been living it for a very long time. If you are unsure whether you've been living with OCD in long-term, then you need to try to get a better understanding and control of your obsessive thoughts.  Consider exploring other theories to help understand this symptom (e.g. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder - CBT) or see if you are on the right track with your therapist.  Even if you are not on the right track, this may give you some ideas, information, and resources that will help guide you on how to reduce these symptoms (e.g. mindfulness exercises, relaxation techniques, etc.)"

"I have been dealing with depression and anxiety for a number of years. I have been on medication, but lately my depression has felt worse. Can counseling help?","Thank you for asking this important question. I find that there are three steps to getting ready for treatment. Step one is expressing interest in wanting to receiving treatment for the outcome of positive behavioral change. Congratulations you did the first step! You are showing your readiness to start counseling by asking this question. Now the second step is to find a counselor who specializes in treating clients with Anxiety and Depression. The therapeutic orientations I have found to be helpful in treating clients with  Anxiety and Depression are a combination of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with Mindfulness, and Solution Focused Brief Therapy. Receiving meditation for your symptoms if part of the treatment, and the other part is receiving counseling to increase your resilience for future events. Research has found that medication and psychotherapy treatments together shows the most effective outcome for Depression.  The third step is to increase your positive self-talk to motivate yourself to attend treatment. As counselors, we are aware of the anxieties and fears that are associated with talking to a new professional for the first time. However, remind yourself that you are doing this to improve your well being. I hope this was helpful, and good luck with your treatment journey.",It is also possible that the level of medication is impacting the quality of life for the individual.

I love my girlfriend so much. I get an erection even just thinking about her or seeing her. But the two times we tried to have sex I couldn't get an erection. We've only had sex once and it was a long time ago.    Why this is happening and what can I do about it?,"I want to be short and brief about this. First, If you can achieve a good erection at anytime without your girlfriend, your penis is fine. However, erections work through getting enough blood flow to the penis. If you are having any sort of mental related concern (anxiety, depression, stress, etc) it can cause your blood vessels to constrict and keep your penis from becoming erect. After reading your concerns, my questions would be: What are you thinking about right before and during sex?"" ""Do you feel anxious or nervous during that time?"" Have you ever experienced not getting an erection before?"" I am assuming it has do to with what you are thinking and their is a certain amount of anxiety you are having during or right before sex. If you want to work this out, I would encourage you to work on your thought process and learn to relax your mind and your body (meditation/relaxation exercises). Focus more on enjoying the experience through your 5 senses. What do you smell, take it in and enjoy it. What do you hear, take it in and enjoy it. What do you see, take it in and enjoy it. What do you feel, take it in and enjoy it. Calm yourself! Not having an erection is not the end of the world and happens all the time to men. If you freak out about it, it will happen more. Just relax, believe it is normal and try again and ENJOY the beauty in front of you!",Is this an emergency?
Then turn right back around and say he loves me and needs me. This rollercoaster is crazy.,"Yes, I agree with your view about the ""rollercoaster"" sounding ""crazy""!Concentrate on knowing what your reasons are for staying with this guy, given the broad facts that you state.What are you gaining from being together and are these gains outweighing how you feel when your companion says the opposite of what he just told you?Also, examine yourself for any fears of being alone.Very often, people stay in detrimental relationships because of a fear that being alone will feel worse.It may, initially feel this way after a breakup.This is from change itself.Eventually, stability and peace of mind return, and being alone with oneself is preferred to being taken on an emotional rollercoaster by a partner.","Hi, I am a licensed therapist and have dealt with depression, trauma, anxiety, and other disorders.

What could be causing this, and what can I do about it?","If you haven't already, please see a doctor.  ED can be caused by any number of physical conditions and you need to get checked out.  Once you have ruled out any physical issues that interfere with getting an  erection, it's time to look for more subtle causes.  Unfortunately, you may have gotten yourself into a mind set of ""I hope I can, but what if I can't?""  which is certain to interfere with performance.Again, rule out physical causes (can you tell I think that's important?), then talk with your wife about working  together to find the right approach.  It might be a good idea, for example, to take the pressure off by enjoying each other without intercourse.  You can have great sex without penetration and you can have physical intimacy without sex, so slow down and experiment.  You might find more pleasure than you expect when you can relax knowing there doesn't have to be a ""finish line"".Again, yes the  third time, SEE A DOCTOR, just in case there's something going  on.  Once you get the all clear, find joy and spontaneity with your wife again by being creative and pressure free.","If this isn't related to low sexual energy, depression, and anxiety, and is a major driver to some degree for the issues you have with your wife, then it's possible that there's a chemical imbalance in your body that is causing both your problems with intimacy and depression, along with your anxiety.
It's possible that the problem is that you've had sexual intimacy in the past that wasn't quite as fulfilling as you'd like or that your wife may not want to have same level of intimacy with you. You could try to ask her if you are ""too much"" for her, and if she doesn't want that, it may be a sign that it doesn't work between you two. However, if she is not interested, then you are going to have to seek a different therapist.
Remember, this is one therapist's opinion and diagnosis, not the diagnosis of any other professional."
"I find that I imagine things sexually, and I hate it because it puts strain on my relationship. I feel helpless and guilty. I want it to go away, and I want to make my woman happy again.","It is completely understandable that you would like to find a way to make these intrusive thoughts go away, however, your feeling that you can't control having these thoughts is accurate. It's also understandable that you would feel helpless and guilty, given that you see how these thoughts are effecting your relationship, though I would encourage you to go easy on yourself and remember that you aren't choosing to have these thoughts. I'm sure that if there was a switch to turn them off, you would flip it.There is no magic technique or pill that can guarantee these thoughts will go away, however, therapy may still have a lot to offer. In working with a competent therapist, you may be able to gain insight into where these thoughts are coming from and develop new ways of relating to them so that they do not leave you feeling as helpless and guilty and can be more present with your partner. Though there is no guarantee that the thoughts will go away, this may also be a result of work with a therapist. Either way, you may be able to find a way to deal with the thoughts and show up in your relationship in a way that will be satisfying to you and your partner.","You ask, I write.  I'd have liked to have done more than I did with my love life.  More than you and I did.  I think a good way to start with what you want is to know your boundaries and to communicate what your boundaries are to your partner.  What is appropriate for a man is often not appropriate for a woman and vice versa.  Be sure to talk to your partner about your needs and wants for the sake of the relationship.  Are you sure you are both on the same page about the way you want to pursue the relationship?  If not, try and go back to the beginning and have the whole conversation over. If you are a man in a relationship, then I bet you will be able to find out more about what your partner needs from you.  A relationship can be very fulfilling if both people want it to be.  But it can be very frustrating if one or both of your partners desires are not being fulfilled in the relationship.  You can also ask yourself what would truly make you happy and what would not.  What will you be missing if you do not have your love life as it is?  It may not matter how much your relationship is happy if you are not happy.  If this can be true then you may want to learn to love yourself.  Love youself is what makes you a good partner too."
"He is always telling me our fights are only and all my fault, he bashes me to our young child, and he is addicted to a few substances.","The behaviors you describe are boundary violations.  You can not change your spouse, but you can respond to his behaviors in ways that protect your boundaries and ensure your safety.  This is very hard to do without support.  Finding a therapist who understands the dynamics of abusive relationships may be helpful.  If you are not ready to do this, I recommend the book ""Boundaries"" by Dr. Henry Cloud and Dr. John Townsend.  It's a great resource for helping one recognize boundary violations and learning how to respond to them in ways that are constructive!","When you are caught in an argument you will not hear what the other person said or what you think you are doing wrong. It’s about not being heard. When a child is bad, parents know that they need to look at the cause of the behavior and find ways to get back on track. Your son's addiction may be something you want to address and you may need to seek support for yourself."
"She was raised by her abusive father and his wife. 30 years ago I shot and killed my rapist and was convicted in Louisiana. I lost custody of my daughter and served 5 years. When I was released, she was 5 and didn't remember me. Many many sad memories came from my having to leave her visit after visit, having to leave her in Texas to travel back to Louisiana. She doesn't remember that. I do. Over the years, I thought we had developed a close mother daughter relationship. She gave me good reason to doubt that on several occasions but especially last year. I have been cruel to her verbally and to my son who I met years after giving him up for adoption. Last night, I was angry at the world and afraid of God. I drank and cussed out a maintenance worker for not doing his job 4 months running. Now I'm not only feeling guilty for that but afraid of being evicted now. Help.","Was either parent abusive or violent toward you?You sound to have suffered emotionally in your relationships since early in life.One point to consider is to strive for moderation in what you offer in relationships.A lot of what you've lived through is extreme, either as victim or perpetrator.If you imagine that apologizing to the custodian for the way spoke to him, would calm him down, do so.At the very least, you'll be actively resolving your guilt over cussing at him, and fear of his retaliation.","First, take a moment. Breathe. There is no need to try to explain your hurt to anyone else. There is no need to defend yourself. What is needed is to feel secure. Secure enough to stay in the house. Secure enough to let her know that you would hate to see you go. There will always be anger and fear, but some of those are normal. They come out at times when you're hurt. It is important to be aware of this as well. Take a drink of water and start from the top of your head. Just the top. There's nothing else to do.  Do not try to make the best of the situation. You did the best you could when you were able.  There is not much more that can be done."
"Her father and I have been dealing with this problem for quite some time now. She is an adolescent, and the problem is mostly food. She is now overweight, and we just don't know what to do anymore. She can be disrespectful and doesn't listen to or respect what we say.","I would be curious about there potentially being some emotional or physical trauma in your daughter's history that she is struggling with. Physical trauma is usually easier to identify, but emotional trauma can be feeling a lack of emotional connection in her important relationships, having experienced bullying, or some other emotional injury. The fact that there are some defiance symptoms going on suggests that she might be in need of a safe place to process what she's going through, and the potential issue with control or meeting emotional needs with food is also concerning. I would recommend looking for a therapist/counselor who works with children/adolescents in the area of addressing trauma for an assessment. They may be able to ask the right questions to see whether trauma is truly the issue.","Your mother must be doing too much work to her. She sounds a bit angry or frustrated that your daughter is struggling with food. Is there any reason why she is more focused on her own needs than the child's? Also, I'm sure you don't need to be constantly worried about her weight. It's important to love your child no matter what. She needs guidance to stay at a healthy weight, but she's still your child."
"My boyfriend of five years told me he cheated on me during our relationship after we broke up. We've since gotten back together and are trying to make it work. I don't know how to trust him now, but I really want to make it work, and it seems like he does too. But my trust issues are getting in the way and causing problems.","Hi Michigan,This is a common issue. How do you trust after you know someone is capable of hurting you? I totally get that it's hard, and I believe it's worth it if you truly love and want to be with someone. You can be stronger in the scarred places. I would suggest that you each have a separate job to do to rebuild this trust. It is definitely possible to rebuild it, because anything is possible if both people want it enough.Your boyfriend came clean to you...this is pretty crucial. He chose to honour your needs rather than keep the secret. You can use that as evidence in your ""proof that he loves me"" file. Work on that file...thicken it up. Having a thick ""he does care about me and wouldn't hurt me again"" file will help you. Other things that he can do to help you thicken that file (because after all, his behaviours caused this problem): answer all your questions, don't brush you off if you're feeling insecure, treat you as though you're a priority, avoid questionable contact with other women, have open communication, give you passwords to devices so there is transparency. He can help you to understand where those behaviours came from...why he cheated in the first places (although people aren't always good with those 'why' questions!)You can focus on telling yourself that people change, that he deserves a chance to show you he can be loyal (or at least you've decided to give him that chance), and that you want to be a trusting person. If you act like a trusting person, you will likely feel more like one. Don't go snooping, don't interrogate him. It's normal you might feel scared and try to tell him that when you do. Let him know what happens that leads to you feeling scared.This is a start for you. A good therapist can be helpful too!","Hi [user], Thank you for coming in. The information you've provided tells me that I am able to help you and potentially the other party get to the point where you begin to trust one another again. It is important to remember that we must all go through this in our own way. However, the key that seems to be in play between us is that my patient is getting a little bit tired of being talked about. I'm not sure you are able to find what you want and what you need in your life. It can be really difficult to be happy in a relationship with someone you are not in love with. The only way out of this may be to get professional help from a therapist. I wish you the best in getting to the point where you begin to trust your boyfriend again. The fact that you are willing to keep working at it shows strength, so I'm glad to see that you are willing to get professional help at any given time."
I'm 17 and I'm sick and tired of going back and forth. I'd like to stay at my mother's house. This problem has really affected me. I've had anxiety attacks and suicidal thoughts and self-harm in the past.    Currently I'm going through anxiety and my thearapist is not available. How do I handle this?,"I am so sorry to hear you are going through this. Divorce can be so disruptive in a child's life.I'd really need a lot more information about your situation before I'd feel comfortable offering any advice or suggestions. There are so many variables, and not knowing the whole story, any advice could possibly make your situation worse.I do see some positives, though. One, you say you have a therapist. That's great! I hope you're able to talk to them about this soon. Still, they can't give you legal advice, and a lot of this situation may be dictated by the law. What your therapist can help with, though, is dealing with whatever situation you have to follow by law. If you can't change the situation, you at least need to learn how to cope with it better. Two, you're 17. When you're 18, you're legally an adult and will not be bound by any custody rules or visitation plans in place. Honestly, teenagers usually have a lot of say with the courts in custody arrangements. Since you didn't specify more on the situation, I have no idea what your specific situation is. Were your parents ever married? Are they separated or divorced? Was there ever a court hearing for custody? Not all couples have an official court order arrangement. All families are different, too. Was there abuse between your parents? Towards you by one of them? Does either of them have addiction issues, major health or mental health issues, or anything like that? You mentioned that you want to live with your mom, but didn't say why. Are you afraid to tell your dad you want to stay with your mom? Is mom the lenient and fun parent while dad is the more strict one, or is there something else going on? This isn't a decision that should be placed entirely on you, and it also isn't a decision that anyone else needs to make on your behalf without your input. But advice on what to do needs to come from the people who know more about your situation so they can help recommend the best thing for you. Whatever you do, hang in there! 18 will be here before you know it. Focus on that. Freedom. College. Plan for your future that YOU control, and focus on making it the best it can be. Do not let the anxiety and depression cloud your thoughts and make you do something irreversible.","Hello!  I'm sure you'll be able to continue through therapy as soon as you are available, and in the meantime,I'd like to have a chat about your anxiety and self-harm.I know that you are feeling that you are the only one who feels this way, and that you are the only one who has anxiety.I also am aware that you're struggling with self-harm, as you said, but I'm not sure of what type of self-harm you are struggling with.Do you know?If you do, we can talk and figure out where to go.My goal is to help you find ways to work through things that are worrying you, and that may also be causing you some anxiety."
"A few nights ago I talked to this girl I know about my self esteem issues for the first time. We talked for hours and she told me time and again that I was a great guy. She told me I was attractive, and have a great personality, etc. I really started to feel better about myself by the time I woke up the next morning. Now, though, I can't stop thinking about her, but I leave to go back to college in a few days and I go to school 4 hours away from her. So now I feel constantly depressed because even if I told her how I felt it wouldn't matter. I feel helpless and I don't know what to do.","Hey!  It takes a lot of courage to share your feelings with someone!  And it sounds like you have been lucky to meet someone who makes you feel safe enough to explore some of your more painful feelings.  A big part of the process, however, of strengthening your self-concept is learning how to tell yourself those positive messages that you heard from your friend!  Leaving for college may also be contributing to your feelings of unsteadiness.  Try this - Make a list of all of the positive things that you know are true about yourself.  Ask your friends and family to contribute to the list.  Then carry it with you in your wallet - and when you need a self-esteem boost, take a look at it!  You are in a season of life that presents lots of challenges and opportunities.  Reach out to your long-distance friend when you need support - and take a walk over to the campus counseling center and check out what they might have to offer.  Be Wise!","As you may already know, you know, in therapy it is essential to remember that what a person says to you is often less important than what you think of them. After all, you are being taught who to be like and not be by others. In this way, you and the other person will need to give to one another an equal amount of love and respect to make the relationship last. Now, I think that you should continue to tell her that your feelings are real and that you would like to spend more time with her but that I have to move on and study. You don't need to know her plans to be able to care for yourself because that is what you need to do. There is so much more of the world you need to go out and explore. You have so much to see and do and more to teach the people you know. In the end, I believe that, you are a worthy person, and you deserve to be happy and healthy. If you would like to talk with someone about depression and your feelings, feel free to contact me."
"I suffer from adult ADHD, anxiety disorder, and depression. It has been difficult to find a doctor in my area and my primary physician won't help. I am unemployed and overwhelmed. What would you suggest I do?","I would check out agencies that offer affordable counseling based on your income or very low cost counseling sessions, i.e., Pacific Clinics, Hathaway Sycamore, Pasadena Mental Health Center, Burbank Family Center. If you google affordable or low cost therapy in your particular area you will find resources to help you.","You have multiple paths you can take that are going to be helpful for you in the current circumstances of your life. First, I would recommend that you seek a referral from your insurance provider. In order to find an affordable provider, you might want to contact a local medical clinic or social worker in your town.  Some medical clinics and social workers can provide referrals for mental health services. Additionally, your insurance provider will want to see you, to assess your overall health and see if a referral is the most economical option. When referring you to a therapist, it is important to use a referral that is available through your insurance provider. Additionally, it is useful to talk to your current doctor, talk to the doctor about your feelings, and ask if they would be willing to work in partnership with you to help you get a referral to a therapist who can help you with your ADHD, anxiety disorder, and depression.  Also, it is wise to know that you can contact a therapist to see if the clinic is willing to set up a consultation. You might not even need to see a therapist because it is possible that you can help yourself. The first step to finding the help you need would be to decide who you want to work with.  I have heard from other adults with similar struggles that some types of therapy can help greatly with people who suffer from ADHD and depression.  Even though I am not a therapist, I think this is a good first step to take."
"My boyfriend lost his dad to suicide. He says that because his dad died, so did his heart. He says that he can't be there for me or love me anymore and wants nothing to do with me ever again. Why is he doing this when we were very happy together? He says that I have done nothing wrong but he just can't be with me.","I am sorry to learn of this.  You must be extremely frustrated and heartbroken.  To begin, he is correct.  You have done nothing wrong.  This is entirely a coping mechanism in overdrive.  It is fear.  It is anger.  It is extreme sadness.  It is feelings of abandonment.  It is intense emotional pain.  It is his way of protecting himself from potential unexpected additional loss.I am not familiar with how old this post is, but often, it will require time and understanding.  If he speaks with you, encourage him to get grief counseling.  Do not encourage it for your relationship, encourage it for his betterment coping with losing his dad.  Start there.  Good Luck.","I'm so sad and frustrated as you are. The fact that he says he doesn't love you is very bad and this will only make you feel sad and insecure. If you can't do anything to change how he feels about you or it won't fix any problems he has with your relationship. There are some things you could try so that you feel better. Have a talk about your feelings, and talk about how you feel about him as a person, and how you feel about your own life. Also make sure that you don't blame yourself for what happened to him. You can't control his feelings or decisions, and you can't please everyone.  What you can do is understand that one person's feelings isn't the only factor in a relationship.  There are also other factors such as love, respect, and empathy.  If he doesn't respond in an emotionally healthy way, you may want to move forward.  I hope that the most important thing is that you do not feel bad about yourself or your relationship."
I haven't uttered one word to my boyfriend in days. Now I'm over it and don't know how to approach the situation?,"In any relationship, it is important to be able to say ""I'm sorry"" because it shows vulnerability and openness. I recommend that you sit and have a discussion with him now that you are calm about why you were upset and how you would like to handle such incidents in the future. If you find yourself becoming upset again, I encourage you to take a 20 minute break and then come back to the conversation once you are no longer heated. Studies show that talking or discussing arguments are more effective once you have cooled down and you are more likely to hear/understand what your partner is trying to convey.","I understand this feels like a long time without any communication. This is a common problem, and I have one more message that is simple. You and you boyfriend need to talk to each other about what you have to say to him. It's very important that you and your boyfriend talk about this. No need to be angry, or to accuse or blame each other.  That will make it more difficult for him to talk to you in the future. You may consider meeting with a mediator, so you are able to discuss the issue between you and your boyfriend.  It can also be helpful to talk with one of your friends or family members."
"My boyfriend and I have not had sex in a couple of weeks. He had to have a cyst removed on his testicles. I have been wanting to have sex with him for a while now, and it drives me crazy not to be able to make love to him. I'm scared to touch him and get close to him because I'm afraid that I will hurt him.","Are you talking with your boyfriend about his doctor advises on starting to have sex again?Being able to talk together about topics that involve both of you, will establish a new type of intimacy on an emotional level.Also, there are many ways of making love.  If your bf's cyst hasn't yet healed, then another way of both increasing your emotional intimacy and learning different love making suggestions, is to read about these together with him.I hope the two of you enjoy learning new ways of sexually taking care of one another, while developing more emotional closeness in the process.","Hello, it sounds like you are feeling anxious, insecure, and scared to be physically close to your boyfriend. It's also understandable that you want to be able to trust your boyfriend, as trust can be a building block for close, loving, and intimate relationships. The fact is that he's had a really tough experience with his testicles and it may be helpful for you to talk about this with a medical professional to get his best possible care and to learn about any physical or psychological needs his body may have. He has been involved in an emergency situation, and you likely know that this requires careful attention. But, for you and the relationship, what has the medical team suggested? The good news is that even though we don't have the complete details of what happened, it is pretty clear that his testicles are hurt, and that he needs help with any physical pain or discomfort. As for your feelings of insecurity you may want to talk to a therapist about these feelings too. This may help you work with fear, fear, and guilt, which in turn will bring about greater feelings of self-worth."
"I don't have time to live or take care of myself at times. It's causing depression, stress, and anxiety. I don't know what to do.",I'm not sure whether you are referring to having a lot of activities after school or that homework is overwhelming. Can you set aside a couple hours a week for yourself as a place to start?,"You're feeling a sense of overwhelm in your life when you are not able to take care of yourself. You are not alone as many people in their lives deal with mental health problems. But you are very open to help and wanting to learn more about this situation. Since the issue can't be solved by talking to others, we can see what is going on. First, we need to explore some questions that may help understand how you feel. Are you in a relationship where you feel supported? Are there any resources you can call, who will help you? Are you alone in any part of your life that causes you stress? Is there anything in your life that you wish was different? Do you see anything that makes you feel bad about yourself? Sometimes we need to learn to accept ourselves as they are, rather than trying to change to be someone we're not. It takes time and practice, but here are some steps you can begin taking today to support yourself: 1)Practice Self Care- Even though you said that you don't have time to do self care, this is something you want to do. Taking time to be able to take care of yourself when you have energy and time is one of the most important things you can do for your mental health. As you get more comfortable with yourself, as you become more aware of how you feel you can use that to make decisions that will lead to a better quality of life for you. 2)Say NO-This is so that you don't feel obligated to do anything. 3)Recognize your feelings. When you are feeling you get stuck, it helps to acknowledge what you are feeling. 4)Acknowledge your feelings and accept that you have more to experience than you experience right now. A lot of people don’t acknowledge their feelings because they don’t know how to do it. 5)Practice Acceptance. When someone says something, it is not always appropriate to say the same thing back. If that's the case, just say no.Accepting that some things are out of your control may help reduce the amount of stress you feel. 6)You can get more help and know that you are not alone. There are many helpful people out there. In fact, you might even be surprised at what you find. Don't be afraid to reach out to someone.  First, learn to accept your feelings. Not all of your feelings are bad, but some feelings can"
"Every once and a while, I think about my ex-boyfriend from four years ago, and my current friend. It’s like I can't get past it, and I need some kind of closure. I keep thinking about how we had something, but it got cut off due to parental intervention. Nothing was ever wrong with it. Now we've become friends, but there's this huge sexual tension between us, or at least I feel it when we're physically in the same place.
   Two summers ago, we saw each other casually for a while, but we never had sex then or while we were dating, which was only for two months three years ago. I'm now in my 20s, and my current boyfriend is amazing and in his 30s. Despite the age difference, I know we're a really good match. We've never really fought and are able to make compromises and talk everything out. I tell him everything. Also, my ex-boyfriend has a girlfriend now as well. He’s been seeing her on and off for the past two and a half years, besides when they broke up and we had our casual thing. That summer, I told him I didn't want anything serious and broke it off. Only a week later, he had gotten back together with his girlfriend. His girlfriend is kind of mean spirited. I'm sure she may be different around him, but I worry about him committing to her in the long run. They're supposed to move in together soon. But still, I feel this connection with my ex-boyfriend, and I feel like he does too.    I don't know what to do. I need some closure or I'm not going to be able to move on from this. I don't know what it is, but it's driving me crazy. I’m so happy with my current boyfriend, and I know he will do everything in his power to make my life beautiful and fulfilling. He’s such a good person. I also know my ex-boyfriend smokes marijuana and does other things, but I can't get it out of my head. I'm trying to take a nap right now between classes, but I can't sleep because my mind is racing. I've never been so hung up on something for this long ever.
   I want to just talk it out with my ex-boyfriend, but I don't know if that's a good idea because of the possibility that it could blow up in my face. If he told his girlfriend, everything could go wrong because she hates me. If my current boyfriend knew, he would be crushed. On one hand, I want my ex-boyfriend to say no to having feelings for me, but I would be terrified of what to do if he said he has feelings too. Where would I go from there? On the other hand, I feel like I can't move forward in my relationship with my current boyfriend without closure from this. Sometimes I wish I could just cut off everything that had to do with my ex, but I don't want to.
   Please help me, because I really have no idea what to do.","If you're in a relationship and you're having strong thoughts about someone else, it's important to pay attention to that. Although you say you're happy, I'd suggest looking really carefully at the relationship you have and whether you're getting everything you need. Is there a physical connection with your ex that you don't have with your current boyfriend? It could be that your boyfriend is marvelous in many areas, but that you just don't feel excited about him for some reason. That's a pretty important element to be missing.It may be that, even if you are happy with your current boyfriend, you still hold something special for your ex. If you feel the need to see what is possible there, I think you have to tell your boyfriend about that and end it with him first. You can't have everything.If you truly feel that you want to be with your current boyfriend, you will do well to stop thinking about and focusing on your ex, because thoughts of him will interfere with the growth of your current relationship. The grass isn't greener... A therapist can help you to focus your energies and thoughts on the present, rather than an imagined version of the past or future.","It would be good to know what happened last summer, like why you went to a relationship with my ex-boyfriend. You didn't say what happened to make him go back with his girl right away. Was it something about the way you two interact with each other or other things? You might find it helpful to talk to your ex-boyfriend or ask him why he had a lot of sexual tension or feelings towards you. But to help you further, I would be interested in hearing about the last thing that happened with you and your ex."
"I keep feeling paralyzed and unsure during interviews. Previous jobs have fired me for lack of performance, and five employers have rejected me after extensive personality tests and interviews. I'm afraid of continuing because my depression is getting worse. I'm already humiliated working for temp agencies and doubt my self-worth as a provider for my family.","It sounds like you are feeling pretty overwhelmed and stuck between wanting to improve your work situation and worrying that you won't be able to. It is possible that the paralysis, uncertainty, and self-doubt that you describe are contributing to your difficulty in getting  and maintaining a satisfying job as employers generally like to see that a potential employee is confident and can think on his or her feet. With a competent therapist, you may be able to get more understanding of the roots of these feelings and learn how to move forward in your search for a better work life in a way that leaves you feeling confident and capable.","It sounds like you are in the thick of it! I know the current environment you are in has really tested your self-worth as a provider, which is something all therapists deal with. I'm sure you have gotten pretty good at what you do to provide for your family. You have the ability to work so hard, and do such an amazing job. It sounds as though you could have continued your career without this issue, and not feel this frustration.  It seems to me that my first question for you is:  What specifically makes you feel so paralyzed during interviews?  You know the people who know you better than anyone else have heard a lot about your behavior. You know that you are capable of being the best, but you are still finding yourself struggling to feel like you are being good enough.  What kind of feedback or questions do you like or dislike?  Sometimes it is better to know what to avoid and what to ask, than to be overly worried about answering a question, or how you are answering it.  It might be useful to try and narrow down exactly what your specific anxieties around each interview are.  I know, I can understand that interview questions, and in particular some of the questions, can be very difficult for those of us who have a good sense of confidence in ourselves.  If you were able to narrow down just what was bothering you, as I have done with your current situation, it could easily solve one of the issues you might have.  It is something to do with your self-worth?  How would you describe it in your own words?  If you're already at a place where you are doing the work that you need to do to grow in your ability to handle stressful situations, then it would be wise to take some time off, and not work until you feel that you have a better sense of who you are.   You are definitely capable of being confident and a good employer, and I am sure you are deserving of having the career path you are longing for."
"I feel so alone. I have so many people around me, but it seems as they just listen and dont understand. They say it will all be okay, or they don't listen to me st all. Everyone says they are here for me but it doesn't feel like they are. Why do I feel so alone?","We feel alone because we are not comfortable with being our self. When you find that nobody is around do you feel alone? Your never alone. Once you take the journey to really understand who you are and unconditionally loving all that is you, there will never be an alone moment. We seek outside of self to fill inside. This is the big lie of the planet. All you need and have ever needed you supply yourself. www.lifecounselingorlando.com","The need to understand this and feeling lonely while people talk to you, but you feel like you don’t hear them are things that can really hurt and make things feel very much harder. Since you are feeling alone even when you have people around you you have a pretty big reason to feel that way. You may be feeling some shame or humiliation about your own feelings of loneliness so you're feeling this way in order to avoid what you suspect that will happen to you. Your feelings are real, even if they aren't as visible as the feelings of someone else's. In fact, the fact that you feel this way despite being surrounded by people is the only possible source to keep those feelings alive. It means that your feelings about loneliness are more important than your feelings about how you seem to be seen by others. If you feel this way, and you feel as though you're isolating yourself from others, then you may need to start really paying attention to the feelings in your heart and whether they are supported by what you are doing in your life, as well. Your feelings in your heart should be the ones that hold the most power in your life, so you may want to stop relying on the rest of the world to hear what your heart is saying. It takes time and awareness to be able to listen to your heart, but it’s worth it."
"I'm depressed often, and my mind goes a million miles a minute. Every once in a while, things are okay for a few days. After a bit, I start noticing that I am picking at my skin profusely. After roughly a week, the anxiety is back and still picking. Sometimes I find myself causing fights to have change.","Hello, and thank you for your question. I am very sorry that you are struggling. I have a few thoughts and perhaps some of my colleagues will add something else. Depression and anxiety can both be chronic conditions, as you have experienced. This means that they may always require treatment in order to have some kind of relief from them. Treatment could mean medication or some kind of counseling. Some people may take medication for the rest of their lives. Some people may go to counseling at times when the depression and anxiety worsens. As you mentioned, sometimes the symptoms improve for a little while, but they can also come back. When they do, it is important to talk to your medical provider if you are getting medication, and/or to go back to your counselor and talk to them about the symptoms that have returned. Skin picking and some other behaviors are not uncommon for people who are experiencing something like anxiety. Many people report that they do this when they feel anxious, and some say it calms them down. It is not really a surprise that you are constantly trying to change things and even starting fights to do so. These are ways to try to avoid, escape and distract yourself from the feelings of anxiety and depression. That is a very normal thing to do. Nobody likes these feelings, and so distraction is something we naturally try in order to get rid of them. The problem is that things like distraction and escape do not work as a long-term solution. In fact, they usually make things worse for many different reasons. Depression and anxiety can  be treated, but it is likely something you will need some help with. I would recommend finding a counselor who has experience with anxiety and depression. Medication can be helpful, but I still recommend counseling. The reason for this is that the medication can help with symptoms, while the counseling can address the symptoms and provide you with very helpful skills. Be well,Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPCC, NCC","It sounds like you're dealing with the ""cycle of change"" and this change seems like both helping and hurting you. You are caught in a loop of self-care, and if you get to the bottom of that cycle then maybe you'll get some peace from it. The change in your skin is a manifestation of the anxiety and worry about what will happen if something changes. But your anxiety is not being ""correct"" or needed for this change. If you are going to let go of your anxiety, then this will be more likely."
I have three children. The oldest is nine and not my biological child. The middle child is three and the youngest is one. I have a great relationship with the oldest two children but I haven't developed the same level of attatchment to the youngest child. I rarely want her around and look forward to her nap times. Is this normal?,"This is your experience, your feeling and you are wondering if it is normal, which means is this common or the rule. This question about how you feel about your third child leads me to believe you are dis- turbed [etymology: agitated or stirred up].  Feelings are messages from our soul or spirit that something is not right.  So, though  it might be normal [common, the rule]  to look forward to a one year olds nap time when you have a three year old a nine year old, the dis- turbance or stirring up in you, is important and requires your attention, your listening, if you will to your higher self.","What is in our parenting style?  Is it what will lead to our children's growth?  Is it a model that we would like to see our children emulate?  Are our children growing up feeling safe and loved in our home?  If so, what is the first thing to know?  Is the only reason you don't have the same level of attachment as your oldest two are you trying to love, rather than accept your children as they are?  I am here to help you to reach a place of acceptance in your life, and to help you allow your children to reach their full potential.  I have heard people talk about love as being the best thing in the world, but it is important to remember that we all have different ways of loving.  It is important for the adults in our lives to try to understand each other to help us all get better.  If you would like to share more about what is going on in your family, I'd be happy to hear it and answer any questions you may have."
"The eight months I've been dating my boyfriend, I have lied about a lot of things. I slept with a couple guys to get back at my boyfriend for breaking up with me. Now anything I say to him he won't believe, even if I'm being honest. I don't know what else to do at this point. He constantly criticizes me.","Start a conversation with him about your sincere interest to earn back his trust.Ask him what he expects from you so that he will trust you again.If you are consciously willing and do try to earn back his trust, and have periodic conversations with him on whether he feels more at ease with trusting you, then after a few months of this, both of you should feel more secure in the relationship.","A couple years ago I had a similar problem. I was being dishonest and I ended up hurting myself, which is something that has had many effects on my life. I don't know how to go back to normal. In all honesty, I don't even know what to do with my life right now."
"I terminated my counseling relationship with a social worker several years ago. I am now realizing that I would like to begin counseling again. The social worker’s voicemail message says that he returns calls in 24 hours, but he hasn't called me back. I called him on the weekend and made it clear that I want him to call me back. Can he just ignore me?","Mental health providers should promptly return calls from current clients as well as from potential clients.  This is even true if the social worker (or counselor) is unable to make an appointment with the caller.  In that case the social worker should call you back to let you know that he is unable to schedule an appointment with you.In addition, mental health providers have an obligation to follow through with their own communication standards.  For example, if the social worker in this case has an outgoing voicemail message that promises returned calls within 24 hours, he has an obligation to follow through on that promise.All that being said, it is also worth remembering that mental health professionals are just people too. It is possible that he had an unforeseen emergency that kept him from from returning your call promptly.In the end, I agree with Sherry's advice. If you feel this social worker is not a good fit for you, you probably should trust your gut and find someone else who is a better fit.","It appears that the social worker is unable to answer the phone.  This is something that is not always easy to respond to; it is always a matter of personal preference.  The key question here is: does it affect you enough that you want him to take this matter away from you?  What do you consider important and how can you work with the social worker to keep him available to discuss you and your needs to the same time?  In his absence, try to be patient."

The past always feels much brighter and more beautiful than my present. Everything about what's gone feels so amazing; almost like I'm high off nostalgia. But in the end it just makes me feel sadder knowing that all of the memories (and a close friend that left me) are gone forever. How do I move past that and live more in the present?,Do some self-reflecting as to what areas of your life you'd currently like to develop.The good news is you know how happiness feels.That you were able to create situations and dynamics which produced happiness in your life is good motivation to believe happiness is possible and to try new ways to create this in your life.,"To help you move past the past and live in the present, I would suggest looking at what makes the memories seem so bright and beautiful to you.

"Every time I send a message to someone or a group message on Instagram, iMessage, or snapchat people will read my messages but then they won't answer me.    Could it be that there is something they don't like about me? I don't understand why they won't answer my messages. How do I get people to respond to me?","I'm sorry that you are having a difficult time.I wonder about how your friendships are in person. If you get along well with people and have effective conversations with them face-to-face, there could be some kind of technology-related problem.Have you tried gently talking to people about how you send a message and they didn't answer? If you can phrase it in such a way that they recognize that you are asking for information and not blaming them for not answering you, that could be effective.I'd also encourage you to consider how much this is bothering you. If it is causing a significant amount of anxiety (say, more than 5/10 if 10 is really anxious), I would suggest talking with a local therapist.In the meantime, consider talking about this with someone you trust to whom you can get more details to get a more specific answer.","In order for people to respond to your messages they would be willing to understand and accept something about you. It doesn't have to be a large change of things. It may be as small as you choose. Perhaps I am too hard on myself.

"I'm in college currently, so I am not a direct victim anymore. My father is very abusive with his words and actions, and my siblings are getting treated horribly.","Yes you can help!  Emotional and verbal abuse can cause a negative impact in your family.  It is important that you encourage your siblings to seek assistance with a therapist, and maybe help them find one, they should have school counselors available and if not our college counselor may help you to get referrals.  It’s also a good idea to talk to your mom about the issue and ask her if she would like help as well.  If you are concerned about your siblings' safety, contact Family Protective Services in your state, they will investigate and refer your father to classes or therapy as needed. It takes courage to do the right thing, you can do this!¿Hay algo que pueda hacer para ayudar a mis hermanos a escapar de nuestro emocionalmente abusivo padre?Actualmente estoy en la universidad, así que no soy victima directamente.  Mi padre es muy abusivo con sus palabras y acciones, y trata a mis hermanos horriblemente.¡Tu si puedes ayudar!  El abuso emocional y verbal puede causar daños graves en la familia.  Es importante que motives a tus hermanos a visitar e incluso encontrar a un terapista, la escuela debe tener uno disponible, y también puedes pedirle referidos a tu Consejero universitario.  También es buena idea que hables con tu mama al respecto y le preguntes si a ella le gustaría buscar ayuda.  Si te preocupa la seguridad de tus hermanos, contacta a el Departamento de Protección a la Familia en tu estado para reportar el abuso.  Ellos investigaran y determinaran si el hogar es un ambiente seguro par tus hermanos y recomendaran terapia o clases para tu papa.  Hay que ser valiente para hacer lo correcto, ¡tú puedes hacerlo!","You're right, not being a victim in a traditional sense is a huge shift. Not being a victim allows you to focus on how you wish to respond when you are confronted with your father and siblings' abusive behaviour in the future. Also, this kind of therapy could allow you to be helpful to others dealing with the same situations! It could even be a way to begin therapy."
"I've been depressed for quite a while. I've been trying to work through it, and my boyfriend has been my rock. He is honestly the only person I trust enough to talk to about anything, but he decided to break up with me because of my depression. I cannot afford to see a therapist or anything, so he saw no hope in staying with me. My insurance has a $5000 deductible, so I’m screwed. I've had everything from suicidal thoughts to trying to quit my job. I have no one. My family doesn't care about me; they kicked me out when I turned 18 a few years ago. I had friends, but they have all moved on with their lives and have no time for me. My ex-boyfriend is trying to help but is making things worse because every time I see or hear him, I break down into tears. I found out that I will never be promoted now because of my depression.","It sounds like you have been struggling with this for quite some time, using many of the same coping techniques that feel tried and true to no avail. Often, we fall back on coping techniques that would be helpful in other problems (stress, social anxieties, etc.) for our depression, but the truth is that depression requires it's own little tool kit. Depression is all-encompassing, and, based on what you've written, the symptoms are already affecting work and your personal life in myriad ways.  The best route forward would be to seek out counselling, admittedly, but if your insurance deductible is too high, that can be very expensive. I would recommend contacting your Employee Assistance Program (EAP) if offered by your employer. If not, you can look into community centres for counselling options, check if your doctor will give you a referral or your local religious organization. If, however, you are motivated to get your depression under control, there are some great workbooks out there that you can use on your own or with your therapist (as long as your therapist is trained in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, or CBT), such as ""Mind Over Mood"".","I'm so sorry about all the things that have happened. I know that you're asking for help and I also recognize you're asking that question because it affects you. It sounds like you are looking for support. I may not know what you need. And I don't have to know anything about you or your background.I'm just curious how you feel about depression. If you are currently feeling depressed, I'm only doing this to help you find someone to talk to. When you go to the doctor, they may tell you that your depression is something you need to get help for, and you may want to continue therapy."
"She treats me like I'm not in her presence. She’s always yelling at me for no reason. She gives more respect to my brothers than me, but only my brothers fight her while I respect her.","Attention is not equal to love and being valued. It may be precisely because your brothers demand so much more your mom's attention through fighting with her that she pays more attention to them. It is a common situation in families where the ""squeaky wheel gets the grease"" and the siblings or family members who don't demand as much attention end up feeling invisible. It sucks to feel invisible and it is important that there is attention for you and that you know how much your mom loves and values you.  This sounds like an important conversation to have with your mom and if she is not able to really understand or help you address this concern you may want to suggest doing some family therapy where a skilled therapist can help you and your family work this out.","My dear, this is a bit of a struggle for you. When I am with one person, I feel respect for them, and I respect them in turn, and the person who is angry and disrespectful to me can feel my love and respect towards him/her. My name is Thomas. But you call me my friend. If your brother doesn't respect you, then that is your brothers place to do so. Your mother and father have put in a great amount of time to get you to where you are. That must be your life now. The respect, to me, comes from you, so I'd love to help you find it. First, I'd like to know how you feel about your brother. If you don't feel a connection at all with him, and you respect him in turn, that is the first step in you finding the respect you're seeking from him. If your brother thinks that it is his place to tell you how to treat him, then it's time for you to start telling him how he treats you. And that is a lot to put on anyone's plate! However, your brother must put that in her own mind as well. I would like you to take some time, be alone with your thoughts, and determine how you feel as you think about all of the things you're learning about your brother. Also, remember this:  I feel it is unfair that it takes all of your time and energy to address how your brother treats you, and I see what you are going through, and what it costs you. I want to remind you of the times, in your life, when you were treated well, and I feel that your brother could have done a better job. Is there even one moment that you felt this respected to yourself, or is the feeling of respect for you and the other people in your life always only to your brother? Is there even one moment in all of your relationships that you feel respected? The answer to these questions will come through this process."
"I’ve been on 0.5 mg of Xanax twice a day for the past month. It hasn't been helping me at all, but when I take 1 mg during a big anxiety attack, it calms me down. I was wondering how I can ask my psychologist to up the dose to 1 mg twice a day without her thinking I'm abusing them. I just have very big anxiety attacks. Should I stay on the 0.5mg and deal with the attacks or should I ask to up the dose? I'm afraid she will take me off them and put me on something else.","It seems like what you are looking for is a way to advocate for yourself and that's so important in mental health! You know best what is working for you and what isn't, so you are the best person to speak out for yourself to the people that can help you. I have extensive training in substance abuse and medications used in therapy, and I work with many people that take Xanax.  Counselors may not prescribe, but with the right training we can educate and help you move through the complexities of medication usage when paired with therapy. There's definitely some debate about using medication in the counseling world, but many people are prescribed Xanax to cope with big emotional responses.  We don't know much about your situation here--if you are in counseling, what types of other coping skills you've tried to use, etc., so it'd be hard to suggest not taking anything for your symptoms.  You are obviously struggling and sometimes stabilization is the best you can do.  And the fact that you are considering dealing with the attacks as an option is a sign you are willing to negotiate your dosage and maybe even the intense fear you are experiencing.  That's seriously so courageous.A little bit about Xanax--Xanax is a drug in the Benzodiazepine family and is fast-acting.  That means it does only help short-term, but your body also builds a tolerance to it pretty quickly (just as people build tolerance to alcohol).  That could be why they aren't as effective for you at the dosage you are taking, especially if you are prescribed to take them twice a day.  It's really important that you discuss the symptoms you are still having with your prescribing provider, as well as when you are taking the medications so they understand the details of your situation and can determine if or how to modify your dosage.  These providers know a lot about the medication process and the more info they have, the better they can meet your needs.  They are ultimately the ones that will work with you to decide whether or not Xanax is the best for you and your situation.I definitely understand your concern that your provider may basically take away how you cope with panic attacks.  That's a scary thought!  Prescribing providers are typically trained in detecting medication abuse, and it is very common for people with anxiety issues to request higher dosages.  I have had plenty of clients ask for increased dosage.  Not only can this get you the assistance you need at the time you need it, but give you a voice in your treatment.  You may end up using that same voice for request to lower your dosage in the future.I do feel an ethical duty to let you know about some of the dangers of Xanax.  Benzodiazepines are depressants and work on the central nervous system (CNS) to do things like slow down your heart rate, breathing, etc. (as you can feel when they do work).  They should never be taken with any other depressants, such as alcohol, barbiturates, and other medications in the Benzo family.  Combinations like these could be fatal.Another danger is that there's a common pattern of relapse after discontinuing Xanax.  This means that symptoms tend to come back stronger than they were before taking the drug.  The reason for this is because when you are taking Xanax, your brain tries to intensify your fear reaction to override the drug.  So when you discontinue it, your fear reactions are still at those heightened levels.  Your prescribing provider can talk to you more about that and/or the process of tapering off the medication to make that less likely when that time comes for you.If you are in counseling and doing exposure activities, (being exposed to things you fear and sitting through the anxiety response) Xanax does interfere with this process.  The brain can't learn a different response if you feel calm.  This is something your counselor (if you have one) can discuss with you as well.The last thing I'd like to say is that there could be some value to practicing other ways to manage your anxiety if you want to make more long-term changes.  That decision is completely yours!  If/when you feel ready to do that, a counselor can help you learn how to move through anxiety without being as reliant on Xanax.  I hope this is helpful and you find what you need!","The best of advice I can give you is to talk to your therapist about your concerns. There are a few things you can do: Talk to your therapist and tell them that your Xanax isn't helping much. At the same time, you can ask them if they would be willing to adjust it to a 1mg dose of it at other times of the day. If that doesn't help, you can also ask her to discuss a new treatment plan with you. Be patient with your therapist, and you'll hopefully find the right balance that works for you."
"He leaves and is gone for days or weeks but stays in contact and tells me he misses me. He gets defensive when I ask him stuff. We haven't had sex in two months. He says it's because he's not working, I'm pregnant, he doesn't like it here, and he hasn't been on the mood lately.","Well, there certainly is distance he creates between the two of you.Whether or not the reason is from his cheating on you is impossible to tell based only on the information here provided.You could open a general discussion about the lack of closeness you feel.   Maybe he'll be more responsive to talk about emotions than about specific actions he's done or not done.Mostly, entitle yourself to the quality relationship you'd like to have.  Your discomfort and distress are valid and there's no good reason to live with conditions which keep these moods in place, forever.Give yourself time to plan your next move, especially since having a baby will add to each of your responsibilities.You didn't write how long the problem you describe has continued.One possible outcome if its been a short time, is he will resolve whatever currently drives his withdrawn behaviors from you.Your life, your outcome.Trust yourself to know when the time is right to stay or to go.","It sounds like you have 3 issues in this relationship, maybe they could be helped by a therapist. I have not given you a diagnosis in this situation. It sounds like it might be worth talking with a therapist to help you start a relationship with him when this new phase in your lives start up."
My girlfriend just quit drinking and she became really depressed. She told me that she wants to move. What can I do to help her? I want her to stay.,"You're probably not going to like my answer.Your question says a lot about what YOU want rather than what she wants or what may be best for her. Sometimes, what's best for a person is the hardest thing to do, and may be completely opposite of what YOU want.Addictions don't happen in a vacuum. If you've had any experience with addicts at all, then I'm sure you've heard the term ""enabler"". A lot of the times, when people think they're ""helping"", they're actually enabling the addict to continue their self-destructive behavior. Tough love and clear boundaries are needed in a lot of situations, but especially with addictions. Family and friends are often the biggest contributing factor to someone choosing to use/drink, continuing to do so, or relapsing back into it.You said she recently quit. You said she is depressed. She wants to move. When a person receives counseling for addictions, they are encouraged to make changes like this. They need to break the habit, and this means removing people from their lives at times. It means moving to new locations. Anything that may trigger a relapse needs to be identified and removed. Not only that, but the addict needs to do a lot of personal reflection to figure out WHY they use/drink in the first place, and not only break the physical addiction to it, but deal with whatever is the root cause that led them to use in the first place. She may need some time alone to figure out who she is as a person, time to make some decisions for herself and do what she needs to do to be healthy.Don't pressure her to stay. Let her have the freedom to do what she needs to do. If she stays, the decision needs to be hers and hers alone. It doesn't need to be made under pressure. That will only lead to resentment. Support her, but don't try to change her or make her do anything, especially for selfish reasons. Let her go. It sounds like she needs some time to focus on herself right now. It wouldn't be a bad idea for you to do the same.",What has caused you to feel this way about your girlfriend?
"My husband’s ex-wife married a man who was charged with seven felony counts of pandering involving a minor. He, by his own admission, is addicted to child pornography. My step-daughters are now all teenagers. They do not know. My husband’s ex-wife has kept this information from my step-daughters. The step-father has had issues regarding his pornography addiction recently. The ex-wife minimizes it by saying that he has ""repented."" It is a constant strain on my husband, knowing that his girls are living with a man who is addicted to child pornography. My own therapist believes the girls should be told. The ex-wife says her therapist says the opposite.",If the daughters are old & mature enough to understand substance abuse.  They should be told for their own empowerment. KNOWLEDGE is their power of safety and protection.,"I'm sorry you have been asked to take on this issue. I've heard that it is a long and difficult process to uncover what was hidden from the girls. There is not enough information at this point, as it seems to lack sufficient evidence of fraud. The ex-wife claims that his addiction has been reported and corrected, and his therapist says the opposite. Your husband seems stressed over this situation.  The ex-wife may have information she is not sharing as she is trying to hide something from the children.  This situation is difficult for your husband. There are some good points to consider:  First, consider whether it would be beneficial to have the ex-wife open up to your husband and tell him what she knows. It may help to resolve the tension by knowing what her role in the situation is.  Second, consider seeking an independent investigation to determine if she is being truthful. This could help your husband and his children know what is happening with the ex-wife. This is a risky decision to take, but there are ways to manage the stress you are experiencing. Consider consulting an attorney who may be able to help you determine the best path forward. The best path is for the girls to be told the truth, whether it is known or not.  This information would not only be good for them, but it also would help your husband know what to do with this situation."
"I have PTSD from childhood events and other traumas as an adult. I have panic attacks, nightmares, anger, and at times depression. I feel like I'm always on the edge or just apathetic. Can I fix this by myself?","When it comes to trauma, especially in the event that it has caused you to develop PTSD, there can be a lot of difficulty in attempting to resolve these issues on your own simply because of how strong your urge to avoid it whenever thoughts of the traumatic experience come up. PTSD is best treated with the help of a mental health professional and if using the Cognitive Processing Approach can be treated in as few as 17 weeks. As for your other concerns, many of these can be treated independently if you have the motivation to manage your way through. Panic attacks and depression, specifically, often respond well to self-help treatment manuals. The Centre for Clinical Interventions is a great online resource for workbooks to help you learn to manage the depression and panic attacks. Whether you decide to work through these concerns on your own or in professional therapy, just know that your panic attacks must be managed prior to addressing your trauma. Hope this is helpful and if you have any other questions don't hesitate to ask.","First, I wish you well.  A survivor of PTSD and trauma has an advantage to it.  I would ask to know more about the kinds of traumas that are your biggest concerns.  I don't want to give you specific steps that may not be useful in your situation.  I would ask you to describe in more detail what trauma you experienced as a child and/or what trauma your adult life has caused you.  Do you have a belief about your self as a whole.  Who do you believe that you are, from your childhood?   What childhood events or situations affect you?   Does your current thoughts, feelings and reactions in response to certain events or situations seem to echo some past trauma?   Do you have a tendency to react as if you're being attacked, or by someone who's attacking you?   Have you always been on the edge of your awareness?   I think that it might make more sense if it was a childhood trauma rather than a ""adult trauma"".   If this is the case, I might advise you to see a child psychologist or therapist, or a neuropsychological specialist for any questions about the history of trauma or the development of symptoms.   Do you have an inner critic that is telling you what to do, or what you should feel?   Are you aware of what would change?  \�You are not your traumas.   You are something else.   What is that other thing?   Are you going to spend more time learning about it?  \� I know that this would be a lot of work.  \�But I believe that 100% of the time, 100% of people working on therapy/counseling are willing to do the work.  \�I know the path is long, and has many hurdles, but 100% of the time, 100% of the people working are working towards greater insight.  \�.  \�One does not always feel the change.  \�However, the change can"
"I used to be the funny guy of the group—the class clown, if you will. I used to laugh uncontrollably all the time and be able to be social without it feeling awkward. Now I can't laugh at all, and I'm dead inside.","If you look back to when you feel as though you were the ""funny guy,"" I wonder what is different now? It may be that responsibilities have changed or any number of other things.I don't know whether you're also saying that you feel sad or if you're saying that you feel as though you don't have any big changes in your feelings.A lot of us tend to be really busy, and sometimes we over schedule ourselves to the point that we don't have time to have positive time for ourselves. Sometimes even if we are spending time with friends, we're thinking about work and all of the other things we need to do.I wonder if it feels awkward when you're with friends that you trust in an environment that you are used to. Maybe if that is more comfortable for you, it can be a stepping stone to focusing on how you feel better in those moments.It sounds as if you may have had an experience (or more than one) where you felt misunderstood or criticized and now reacting to people feels awkward. If so, try going back to people you trust. Who do you have support from?","I'm so sorry to hear about what's happening with you. If you're ever feeling more comfortable looking at this yourself, I would recommend you talk to your therapist about this."
"I have an eating disorder of binging. I've had gastric sleeve surgery. I need help with issues of abuse as a child, addiction, and abusive men. I have been in therapy for five months and get no feedback from my therapist.","It can be really frustrating to feel like your counselor is not providing you with the help you need.My recommendation in a situation like this would be to let your counselor know how you feel. Specifically tell Your counselor that you don't seem to be getting the amount of feedback you would like.If this doesn't help, then you might want to look for another counselor who will be a better fit for you.","The reason you need more feedback from your therapist is the fact that that therapy is designed for the specific needs of you at this time.  If you are not doing the things you are instructed to do within therapy, then your therapist does not want to help you, because their purpose is your therapy. If you do not follow the guidance that has been provided to you, the therapist will no longer have a way to help you. If your therapist doesn’t keep providing you with feedback, it may seem to be a matter of your therapist not being able to help you, but this is not necessarily true. In fact, if your therapist did not continue to help you, then they would be letting you down."
How can I know if I'm just being paranoid?,"Hi Texas,Oh, that's a powerful idea, isn't it? It burrows into your head. Let's figure this out. First, has your partner given you any concrete reason not to trust them? Have they cheated before? If not, then they deserve the benefit of the doubt until there is evidence. If it's a ""yes"", then it's natural that these fears would be triggered and you can simply let your partner know what triggers the fear and what you need. ""When you refuse to let me see your phone I worry that you're hiding something. I need openness"". If they haven't cheated on you in the past, there are three possible scenarios here. I invite you to take a moment and write down what the evidence is that cheating is going on. What is the specific thing that's triggering your fears? When you have your data recorded, read on...The first scenario is that you have been personally hurt in the past by someone else and you've developed fears that you will be hurt again or that you're not enough to keep someone interested (this is just fear...people cheat for their own reasons, not because we're not interesting). This may be true if what you wrote down is ""They didn't really do anything wrong...there is no evidence. I'm just scared and suspicious"". That's a cue to do some self reflection and calm yourself with thoughts like ""nothing has really happened. I can trust.""If what you wrote down was vague evidence, like for example your partner has been distant or irritable, or you're having less sex than usual, you can try to approach the situation without making assumptions. Trust your gut, but your gut isn't seeing evidence of cheating...it's evidence of ""something"". Ask your partner what's up with accusations or assumptions.The third possibility is that there is some clear evidence that they are cheating. Maybe there are texts on a phone, or someone has told you something they saw. I'd say when there is some evidence, it's okay to present this to your partner and ask what's going on. If this happens repeatedly, and your gut is screaming and there are only excuses or explanations that don't make sense, then it's okay to do a bit of ""research"" and be extra aware of what's going on around you. I hope that helps.","What would we call when you have a strong feeling of worry that you have the power to change the outcomes of situations you have not yet involved in because of what you know, or have been told, or have heard that you have experienced in your past? When you have that feeling, you say, ""I know I need to change how to react to things as I learn more about them, but I don't know how"".   I will let you know what you have been told, how you have reacted, and how this has had effect on you in the future.   Then, your therapist will help you reflect on the past.   You are saying, ""When I did X, how did that make me feel?"", and from the outcome, you can get the answer you were looking for. Your therapist would then help you identify new behaviors.   You have the power to change things!"
We do communicate but one of us has trouble accepting what the other person says. How can I fix things?,"Being able to accept your partner's influence is a key relationship skill. And it's very two sided.  Chances are if you don't feel your partner is being influenced by you, they likely don't feel you are being influenced by them either. The best fix you can practice is to soften yourself into your partner and see how much more open you can be to their influence.  Play with it.","In therapy it is best to communicate with your therapist and the other person involved so that they know what you need and are able to work through it together. I suggest asking them for what they are able to do to work through this issue, or how they see it working? Sometimes they need to work through it individually before it is a collaborative issue."
"I have PTSD. The side effects are really bad and have impacts on sex, anger and my relationships. I even lost my job month ago.    How can I get my life back?","Slowly is the rate at which you'll get back your life.Being traumatized means not feeling safe in almost all areas of life.Be patient with yourself as you try to regain trust that people will not harm you and will be sources of satisfaction in your life.It is possible that the trauma in your life requires such great attention on your part to your own inner emotional safety that you are better off with a less intensive job than the one you recently lost.Try to prioritize restoring your emotional and psychological health.  With this as the top area of your attention then you may have an easier time to accept a lesser degree of involvement in your work and relationships.When you feel angry, try to examine if underlying the anger are feelings of stress, fear, insecurity regarding your position in relationship to the person toward whom you feel angry.   Anger is often the surface reaction to more destabilizing emotions like fear and insecurity.Gradually by nurturing and comforting yourself, living at a pace which is uniquely comfortable to what and how much you can handle, you'll regain your trust in both yourself and relating to others.","Being in a job loss, as it happens in many situations, can bring about a lot of emotions, such as loss of confidence in yourself and your ability to be a productive member of society. To feel like we can recover and regain our confidence can take time, and not all of us have a similar timeline for recovery. Sometimes, things are not as simple as getting back into the job. Sometimes, things that are very difficult for one person are not an issue for another person. Other factors, such as our personality, our support system, and even our beliefs about our abilities, also contribute to how we recover.It is often helpful to check in with your therapists and explore what is going on in a clinical setting so that you get the right help you need. Once your therapist knows what you’ve been experiencing it may be helpful to find resources or programs that you can use to help you regain your confidence in yourself and your abilities.Sometimes, this may mean a change of work or getting a new job.It is often helpful to explore with a couple or a family counselor which may help with understanding some of the other possible factors that are present in your situation and help you to develop coping strategies and change in your belief system."

Sometimes we jump from one relationship to another without giving ourselves a chance to adjust and grieve for the one we had to leave behind. When you find yourself in a situation where a previous partner is coming back into your life and desires to be with you again, it is important to ask yourself what the motivations are prompting that return. Is the person afraid of being alone? Are they jealous of your current relationship? Do you feel the same way about this returning relationship as you did before it was ended? How long and/or how committed is the current relationship you are in now with your current partner? Does your former partner not like being ""dumped"" and maybe they just want to get back together with you so that they can ""dump"" you instead? Some of these questions you may not be able to answer, and some of them might require your own internal reflection.You likely want to make a good decision, and you also might want to consider who it will impact, and how that will happen. Other friends might be upset at this sudden change, and it could create a strain on your friendship. You will want to carefully consider the value of that friendship before you take any actions that could damage it. Also perhaps think about what led you to end the relationship with your previous partner in the first place. Has there been a change in events or behavior that would cause you to think of a valid reason to give that person a second chance? How it will it impact your current relationship?Going into relationships should be done with reflection, patience, and full awareness. Ultimately you choose who is in your life, so you want to make those choices based on appropriate decision making, and with the ability to protect yourself from harm. No one else can make this choice for you. However, gaining the insight of friends or family can be helpful, as can seeking out the counsel of a therapist. In your heart, you will likely find the right answer. Learn to trust that more, as that is where the core of emotion tends to be when you need it. Use your mind to analyze things, but allow yourself to also feel your way through the situation too. The answer will arrive if you let it.",What about how you think you feel about Paul?

"I'm scared that I am with this man so I won't be alone. He should be with somebody who deserves him if this is the case, and I don’t want to hurt him.","While not wanting to be alone may not be the best reason to be in a relationship, it is probably more common and normal a reason than you think.  Since you seem to care about your friend (""don't want to hurt him""), I imagine there are many other reasons that you are together.  I suggest that you talk about this open-heartedly with each other.  The idea of being afraid of being alone sounds like an honest starting place.  Don't try to ""figure out"" whether you should be with him.  Just talk.  The communication is likely to shine light on deepening connection for BOTH OF YOU.In the meantime, your idea that you don't deserve him is rooted in a ""core lie"" that you are telling yourself.  You can read about ""core lies"" and much more in my book, Living Yes, a Handbook for Being Human.  Check out www.LivingYes.org.Be easy on yourself.  You are deserving!~Mark","Let's talk about why this is a problem.

"I am going through a divorce from a narcissistic sociopath who left me for another woman after mentally and emotionally abusing me for 11 years. I have moved to a different state and after giving up my successful business am working as a server at a restaurant. I’m coping as best as I can. Is it normal and healthy to not adapt as quickly and be as strong as I think I should be? I am astounded at his cruelty and how much he doesn't care, as well as most other people in my life. I feel like I don't exist to anyone anymore as there is no contact from anyone who I thought cared about me. My brother just said no to lending me a few hundred dollars for me to live on. I am losing faith in humanity itself.","I am very sorry to hear of your struggles. I think that it is normal to struggle to get your feet under you again after a divorce, especially after leaving a relationship that lasted 11 years, so try not to be too hard on yourself. Take it one day at a time and do the best you can.I notice that you said he left you. This tells me that you didn’t have the strength to leave him on your own despite the fact that you say he was emotionally and mentally abusive and also cheating on you. Low self-esteem can keep someone in a bad relationship because they think they can’t do any better. Also, abusers will make you think that they are the best thing you can get. The way I see it, he did you a favor. You are now free to make your own life whatever you want it to be. Take this time alone to work on you. As hurtful as it may be that other people don’t want to help you, this is something that you need to do for yourself without feeling like you need someone in your life to take care of you. Your statement “I don’t feel like I exist anymore” tells me that in addition to low self-esteem, you also don’t have a clear sense of identify and rely on the people in your life to help define who you are. People can and will let you down. It is important for you to learn to handle disappointment, learn to take care of your own needs, and to gain a stronger sense of self. Do nice things for yourself every day because you deserve it. Even if it is just to soak a little longer in a hot bubble bath, do something that makes you feel good. Find a hobby that you enjoy. Look in the mirror and tell yourself some positive affirmations daily. Google “positive affirmations” to find some that resonate with you. Such statements might be “I am a good person who deserves to be happy” or “I can do this.” Some relaxation and meditation exercises may help you as well. There are some free meditation exercises that you can find online by doing a simple Google search.Take this time to focus on you and try not to worry about what everyone else in your life is doing. When you are a happier, more stable person, the right people will come into your life without you even looking for them. Good luck with rebuilding your life. I know it is hard! Remember to take it one day at a time.","Hi everyone, what a lot of emotions to find. So after 11 years of dealing with this narcissist who has now walked away, you're now being taken care of by someone else. Then, after giving up your business and working as a server and dealing with the other folks in your life you seem to be losing faith in humanity. And all your feelings of isolation, not finding people, or not being heard—all those emotions will probably take a bit of time to get better, but they don't have to be the last things you feel. Your emotions don't have to just be negative feelings to give you the strength to move on with your life. Your feelings of guilt about being so cruel to people like your ex are also going to help as you're not the only one who is cruel to other people! I hear that you do feel you don't exist to anyone anymore. It's okay to feel that way. But it is also okay to feel that you still exist. You still have a part of you that you're willing to grow into. There are a lot of ways in which you feel you may lose your ability to feel happiness, but also there are many other ways in which you can do it again! I'd say this is your chance to find people you will enjoy being around for a long time. I would encourage you to keep going and to keep moving. I'd also say that your job as a server is an opportunity to learn more about helping other people! You're likely better at helping people than you are at helping yourself! What's next in your life? Are you going to pursue education or career training? I am assuming that you will be on track to move your business somewhere new, which I feel is very good and has a lot of potential. I would encourage you to start planning for what the future may look like for you now and in the future. It is good to have goals and it is good to set them for yourself! Most people aren't great at setting goals, they just get stuck in life doing whatever they are given and then get upset when things don't go their way. I would encourage you to look for other people in your town or community to see if you can get involved in their activities. It may sound simple,"
"I can't seem to feel any emotion except anxiety, not even for myself.","Thank you for posting.  I'm interested to hear some more information; such as, if you live by yourself or family, if you go to school/employed/unemployed, and what kind of things do you like to do with friends or by yourself.  Often times, when we are experiencing a strong emotion that we interpret as negative, we put most of our focus on that negative emotion and struggle to see that we do not always feel that specific emotion.  There are typically points in the day (even if it is for only in 1 minute intervals) when we do not feel that negative emotion.  When we overgeneralize, we use words like ""always"" or ""never"" and when we use those words and it may not be totally true, we feel the negative emotion based on an inaccuracy which is not fair to you.  Ask yourself some of these questions: Am I being realistic when I'm overgeneralizing things? Have I ever noticed a short period of time that I wasn't feeling anxious?  What do I notice when I am feeling anxious? What am I thinking about?  When was the last time I felt empathy?  What was different when I was able to feel empathy?  Hopefully this helps get you started.","I've encountered a lot of people who feel the same way that you do and they seem to have the problem of simply not *feeling* anything. This does not mean the person has difficulty experiencing any sensation, it's more a matter of how they interpret the senses...in this case perhaps it's a difficulty experiencing the internal and external sensations of the self. I suggest you try this practice: when you are feeling anxious, say to yourself ""I can feel my anxiety, but I can't feel the emotions associated with my anxiety."" I know this sounds strange, but as you become accustomed to this perspective, you will notice that you can feel the anxiety, but you can't feel the sadness, happiness, fear, or other emotions associated with the anxiety. Often, the reason why this can be difficult is because you only focus on feeling the anxiety and you don't focus on the emotions that are often associated with the emotion.   Try this one thing for two weeks, and see if you feel any difference.If you do, then you may want to explore the connection between your anxiety and your emotions."
"My wife and I have a great relationship except for our sex lives. We are pretty transparent and honest, and basically, she feels bad because she never wants to have sex. She doesn't have the desire. She's also never orgasmed. She feels like a terrible wife and fears I'll cheat on her. She doesn't know why. Last time we had sex, she cried and felt bad and didn't know why she cried. However, she also told me that the last time we had sex, she felt me in her, but it just felt ""ehh"" and wanted to stop. That makes me feel really awful. We rarely have foreplay. Everything I try tickles her, so she makes me stop. We are both frustrated but very much in love. She and I are in our early 20s. We’re married and we have a baby on the way.","I suggest seeking the support of an AASECT certified sex therapist to help work through much of the issues you address, you simply may need some really qualified support.

Since sex and desire can be complex and difficult to treat for most people, the next step is to explore causes for a sexual problem. The reasons for the lack of desire can be many and include various issues such as physical health problems such as hormones, problems with the brain, and emotional issues such as lack of love and intimacy, communication problems and the fact that there are many possible answers to find and work through them together. If you have questions about any of the different issues listed above I’d love to help you explore them further. If you want to speak with a trained professional and have a deeper discussion about what sex and desire are like and how they may be impacted by psychological or physical health issues, feel free to share in the discussion. I recommend taking time to listen and try and listen to your wife (as if you're hearing her from inside her head).I hope you're doing well and finding success in finding love and happiness in your marriage."
I'm obsessing about a terrible breakup. Everything is a constant reminder. How do I move on?,"Let yourself know what you feel.   There is no timetable or known length of how much time a particular person requires in order to feel that the dissolved relationship is behind them.Probably the more you allow yourself to acknowledge your sadness from seeing the reminders, the sooner you will feel fresh and new again.","Your answer to the question of moving on can be found in self-knowledge.  Self-knowledge involves becoming very aware of the things that you do and don't do.  What do you do when you are happy?  What do you do when you are sad?  When you are loving?  When you are angry?  I think that many people avoid things that remind them of a bad breakup. If your breakup was painful, this may be how that pain is stuck with you.  So what you do when you see a picture, or think about a date, or even the smell of the last people you were with, is your answer.   ����������911 in times of crisis."
"I'm in my mid 20s with a husband and children. I love my family, but I feel like I've lost my identity, and I don't know who I am other than a mom and wife. At times, all I can think is what I gave up and how I feel unhappy and trapped, but I know I'd feel like worse without them. I loathe myself at times. I have an amazing life, so why can't I just enjoy it?","Good for you on being sensitive to your human need for personal evolution.Wife and mother are meaningful positions.  And in your case, in order to feel your own growth, other areas of who you are would like your attention.Give yourself time to allow your interest to wander in order to find the area of growth which will satisfy you.Just like you know now that you'd like more than your current situation, trust yourself to know you will also know when you've arrived at another road you'd like to take for your own happiness.","The ""Why?"""" is the first step in getting that answer. Why do you not feel more like you *are*? Let’s start by exploring what that actually means. ""I am not quite who I think I am."" Often this is because the relationship itself is not what we believe it to be.  We get caught in a cycle where we believe we need to prove ourselves, then are upset when we don't. In many cases, we are getting caught in a relationship where we are not fully able to express ourselves. We are not expressing our desires, fears, or fears. We expect other people to tell us how we feel. This leads to two kinds of problems:  1) We have very little feeling (the person we are). We tell ourselves we don't have enough desire and passion (we can be willing to do any amount of work!)  2) We feel that no one really knows us and doesn't feel that we're in a ""vulnerable"" place. This would allow someone to have a more ""real"" you who is happy and not afraid of being hurt.  Then when people express things about our need for validation, we feel like that is what they're really trying to tell us.  We get so busy trying to prove ourselves that we forget to live.  But if we take a step back and look at what's important to us--the things that truly matter--we can re-focus. The people in our lives may not fully ""get"" us, but that's okay. It's important to learn what they can do for you. I suspect you're worried that the other people in your life know the true ""you"" you are, but that is not the case. If you worry that you want to do the ""right"" things, do those things."
My grandma and brother both passed away 11 years ago and sometimes at night I just can't stop crying while thinking about the good memories we had but won't have ever again. I can't sleep at night when the memories and tears come I'll be fine all day then at night...boom! it's like waterfalls from my eyes. Why can't I stop crying?,"Because you're sad and miss the relationship you had w grandma and your brother.The academic point that grief takes a different length of time to lift for each person, is true.Also, from a spiritual perspective, your grandma and brother are still here in loving relation to you, just not in physical body.  Pay attention if you have a sense of talking to them within your mind.  This may lessen your feeling of loss.When you're done crying about missing them, your grief will simply disappear on its own!  It cannot be forced to leave.","I think the answer is that you have the freedom to cry, as long as the crying doesn't cause harm.  Sometimes, tears can bring comfort even while we don't know why they are bringing us the comfort that we would think it would. So while we think we should take all the tears we can for our eyes, it is possible that we might be crying some tears you can't even recognize that you're crying over."
"I've been with him for a couple months. We will talk everyday and he will get mad over something I will say and not talk to me.

I still wanna be with him, but not now.","It sounds like you're pulling away instead of being honest. If you really want to be with him, why not now? If you don't have time for a relationship, why are you dating at all?I don't understand the whole ""phasing out"" thing that people do these days (or ""ghosting"", where you just stop talking and disappear!). I get the sense that this relationship isn't working for you, but for some reason you're stopping yourself from being honest with yourself and him and just ending it. In the early stage of a relationship (the first year), if it doesn't feel fabulous, it's a good idea to move on. It's not personal. You don't owe this person anything. They deserve someone who's totally into them (and so do you) and you're doing him no favors by hanging on to something that's not amazing or giving him hope that it might work better in the future sometime. You don't have to slowly bow out. It actually creates more hurt than gentle honesty. Maybe people don't know how to say it?""I've decided not to continue with this. I wish you the best."" Life is too short!","If you've decided to slow things down, you are not doing anything wrong. You are in control of your own body, and I can only assume that you know better about your needs as well. As a therapist, I am more than happy to help you figure out your own boundaries.

"Sometimes I can't stop thinking about life after death. I was raised in a religion that teaches that we will live on forever either in hell or in heaven.  When I think of living forever (even if it is in heaven which should be good), I feel overwhelmed. I don't like the thought of living forever and ever and ever. Sometimes I just can't get the thought out of my mind and the thoughts lead to panic and anxiety.  Am I crazy? I don't think these thoughts are normal.","You might be surprised how normal you are. Anxiety is incredibly common and while your particular type of existential anxiety might be unique to you - it is very difficult for most people to really comprehend what happens after we die - regardless of the religious or philosophical belief systems we hold. It is the ultimate unknown and some philosophers and psychologists believe that at the root of our day-to-day anxieties is the fear of death or fear of the unknown.  Just as it can be really hard to comprehend the ending of life it can also be hard to comprehend an eternal existence. What these both have in common is that we are imaging a future that is ultimately unknowable and this unknown can provoke a lot of anxiety. Mindfulness based practices like meditation - maybe there is something like this in your religious tradition - can be very helpful in making peace with the unknown in the present moment. The more we can learn to live in the moment - the less we get hung up on anticipating outcomes for our lives that may never come true. Mindfulness practices can help you ground, be where you are , relax and regulate your nervous system so that you are able sleep and recuperate, and train your attention to focus on living the life you want to live now - rather than worrying about what happens after you die. Having said all that - it can be profoundly helpful to speak with someone about your anxiety - especially when you feel haunted by it, worry that you are crazy and can't get to sleep. There are lots of good therapists out there who can help you with your anxiety.","In order to answer your question in more detail, I need to know what beliefs you're talking about. In general you are thinking about heaven and hell and whether you'll live forever.  What are your own beliefs that might be helping to provide comfort?   I'm open to listening to you more if you'd like."
"My boyfriend says I'm nuts. I need to get help because I get an overwhelming feeling that he is cheating on me. Whenever I try to talk with him about it, he always turns it around on me by telling me what I'm doing wrong. I know that accusing him does not help. When his whole demeanor shifts towards me, I can't help but think that something is wrong. Am I wrong for feeling this way? I try to talk with him to make it better. I let him know when I am feeling down. But I am not confident in these things.  Two weeks ago a girl texted his phone 3 times trying to hook up with him. He texted her back with ""Sorry, I've been working. I just read your message."" The girl was trying to get him to call her at a time when he was at home with me. He texted her back with ""Don't text me anymore."" I don't feel like I am way out of the line. But I can't talk with him if all that he will say is that I'm crazy and I need help. What should I do? How will I go about checking if there really is something wrong with me?","Trust your intuition that your boyfriend is involved with other people.You gave examples which strongly suggest this.Quite commonly, a person twist someone's words to convince then of having problems in seeing or understanding their own and other's behavior.Your intuition is again working quite well in telling you that your problem is having a boyfriend who manipulates you, not that you're seeing things incorrectly.One way to check if you're totally misreading him, is to examine whether you feel similarly in other relationships.If no one else who knows you tells you that you're crazy, then this strongly points to your boyfriend twisting words so that you feel wrong.Also, a consult with a therapist would clarify the dynamics between you and your boyfriend.A therapist session would also allow you to think out loud in a confidential discussion, what to do with your newfound clarity!","Hi. I'm hoping that I can give you some advice. I think that you will need to examine whether or not your boyfriend is truly the right boyfriend for you. Not all things change in a relationship and you do not know this until you know what's going on with you. You cannot fix the relationship yourself. You are more in control of the relationship than you are of the relationship itself. If you have a choice between what you expect to happen from a relationship and what is happening in your relationship, then you're in the right place. Sometimes people are wrong about what they want, they are confused about what they feel, and they also don't know what they need. I have had many couples that have problems. Sometimes you are trying to change things and sometimes, no matter how much you want to try, things simply don't work."
"I'm a male in my 20s. My girlfriend is in her late 30s. She's great. She's funny and smart, she has a big heart, and we have an excellent sex life. She recently moved in with me partially because she wanted to and partially because she had no place to go. We fight a lot. It’s mostly my fault, I must admit. She doesn't like my insecurity and lack of trust I have for her. I have trust issues. Also, I can't fathom why a woman like her is with me, so I'm always dreading when a better dude will come along. I don't think she's happy. She's very submissive and she loves me very much, but also the fact that she has nowhere to go must be influencing her decision to stay. I love her so much, but my jealousy is not likely to diminish. I never believed in the whole ""If you love them, let them go,"" but I do now. I really want her to be happy. Should I end it with her? She has no place to go so I feel like I can’t break up with her. I’m literally trapped.","Hi Fort Worth,  I applaud your awareness and insight into the relationship.  Most of us come into relationships carrying old baggage and although you can't change her,  what you can do, is change yourself.  We can usually begin to understand ourselves better in the context of our own upbringings.  That is where we learn what a relationship looks like and it is often not the best teacher.  I wonder about your jealously, insecurity, feeling trapped and a lack of trust.  Has that ever showed up anywhere before?  It has more to do with you and less to do with her.   Your relationship with her is tapping into unresolved issues within yourself.  That is really where you want to focus. Once you understand it and resolve it, you will no longer need to ask anyone else what to do, because you will know.  You are young and just getting started in the relationship world and the healthier you are, the better you will know what healthy looks like.   Know yourself, understand yourself and love yourself.  The rest will take care of itself.  Finding a Therapist can be a big help in this process.  You are asking the question, so I suspect you are ready to look at the man in the mirror.  I believe in you and am wishing you all the best.Sandra Cooper, RN, LPCMH","I think as the guy who wants to be happy with this woman, I am very jealous and I am also sad that she is not happy. Because she is feeling vulnerable, she wants to have support in her life and the only way she has that is with her partner. Because I hate to disappoint her, I think I need to give her some space to get to know other people who could support her in a way she finds satisfying. If I really want her to be happy, I can't force her to be happy. But I can help her to be happy."
"Sometimes, when I look at my pet cat, I think about how innocent he is and how somebody could hurt or kill him. It makes me sad because I love him, but I always think about how helpless he is. There've even been split-seconds where I felt almost tempted to kick him, followed by shame and guilt.","A lot of different things could be happening here. Do you feel angry or sad or anxious when you think about how helpless he is? If you have not actually kicked him, then I would encourage you to look at feelings other than guilt, since you did not hurt him. What else is there?It would probably be very helpful to talk with a therapist about the specifics of this so that you can see what else is happening for you. It could be that you feel safe with your cat, so strong emotions come up because you feel safe.","If you are not strong enough to do something, then seek help for the reason that is causing you to feel that way. It is ok if we have thoughts and feelings of desperation and or panic. You know that those will come up when the pressure is really high in your life, and not if the situation is normal. We often feel more guilty when we are depressed or anxious. Sometimes depression and anxiety have the same symptoms, so the person who makes that decision has to be good at listening to their own body, and to give the person permission to take time for themselves or seek some help from a professional in order to change that dynamic. There is no one who is right or wrong in this and that being the way to start this discussion."
"I crossdress and like to be feminine but I am attracted to women, but yet that seems to bother girls I date or ask out.    How can I approach them about it? should I hold back and keep it a secret, or should I just be up-front about it. I wonder if i should stop or if I should continue to do it since it makes me happy. What should I do?","Thanks for asking this question. I think the most important part of what you mentioned was that you do it because it makes you happy. For that reason, I would encourage you to keep doing what makes you happy.As far as telling girls or keeping it a secret, I don't really think that it's necessarily one or the other, at least not the first time that you meet. In other words, one part of your decision-making could be whether it is something that you always want to address in the first date, or perhaps something that you address after you've known each other for a couple of meetings. The answer to that question may also change depending on who you are dating. I would imagine that each person that you are with mainly due to a different decision this was when to disclose this. It sounds like this is an important part of you, so I would think that if you were going to date someone long-term, you would want them to know about the most important parts of you, including that.I also encourage you to remember that if you meet someone who is not comfortable with this, that does not mean that there is anything wrong with what you are doing, but rather something that the other person is in some way deciding not to continue learning about or choosing to have someone they are dating like to cross-dress.I'd also ask you to consider this: Are the people who you say this to expecting it? My guess is that the answer is probably not. Along with that, Are they going to have questions? I would imagine so.Are you comfortable answering questions?I wonder if you could figure out yourself or with friends (or perhaps even with a therapist) how you would answer these sorts of questions:What exactly is cross-dressing?Does that change the gender that you're attracted to?What does it mean to you?Why is it important to you?And what you want your listening person to know about you related to cross-dressing.There could even be ways that you can start the conversation by asking them to be open to listen to you and ask questions about what they are thinking before they make any quick decisions about you or the relationship.I certainly hope that you find the right person for you. I imagine that having this conversation could be stressful, especially considering the idea that you have had some negative reactions in the past. Remember that talking this through with a therapist could be very helpful.","This is your personal answer so all I can do is give you some insights as to how to approach the question in the most appropriate way for you.   There is no right or wrong answer, this is your choice. The most important thing is that you feel comfortable in your choice.  Regardless of whether you stop doing it, the most important thing is how you feel in your own body.  Trust your instinct and let your own decisions be your own decisions.  What you want and what you feel are important in the end."
"Me and my girlfriend just broke up. She said she loves me but is not in love anymore. This came out of nowhere. We seemed so happy together. It all started when she went to Missouri to visit her family. The first week she was there she was fine then once she went to this one sister’s house everything changed. That's when she told me she loved me but was not in love with me anymore. I thought maybe it was just because she missed her family and she just wanted to be home because she told me that she could not leave them again. Then she told me to come to her in Missouri. So that's what I did. I quit my job I dropped everything, said goodbye to my family in Florida and drove 15 straight hours to be with her. Once I got there everything was fine again.  She apologized for everything and said she didn't mean any of it then we were good for about a week. Then she went back to saying she didn’t love me anymore and had no feelings for me. The only thing that really gets me and makes me not want to accept this is that now she is pregnant. This wasn’t an accident. We were trying to get pregnant, so all this is hard to accept. I love her so much. I have never been bad to her. I've treated her the best I can. I wanted her to be my wife. I was going to propose to her when she got back. Now I'm losing my family and my mind. I don't know what to do.","I am sorry to hear of these troubles. I see a few issues here. I wonder why you were both trying to get pregnant when the relationship seemed troubled? Some people think that they can fix a broken relationship by getting pregnant, and all this does is bring up more problems.You say you never treated her badly, and I believe you. People in a relationship can still be unhappy even when there is no abuse or mistreatment going on. In fact, giving too much of yourself to the relationship and not having a “self” outside of this relationship can be unhealthy. It takes two whole, healthy, happy people who are that way when they are single to come together to make a whole, healthy, happy couple in a relationship. Expecting your partner to meet all your needs or to provide your happiness is not going to work.There are two books that I recommend you buy and read. One is Codependent No More. The other is Can My Relationship Be Saved?Sometimes when you cling and try even harder to hold onto someone, it makes you both miserable. You cannot change her and cannot change her mind. Sometimes the best thing is to let go. If it is meant to be, you will end up back together again. It seems like this is something that she needs to decide since she is the one that keeps doing the leaving. I suggest backing off and letting her go. Maybe she needs time to clear her head and make up her mind. If it is meant to be, she will come back. If not, use this time to work on being a healthy happy you on your own.","Hi Daniel! I'm so sad to hear you're not happy in the relationship, because you know that you are the one who chose this relationship and you have a good history with her, it's important to remember that. At this time, you cannot change what has already happened and it is not your place to tell her how to feel. If you can't move on without doing something for her and don't want to, Daniel, this is not going to change. You still have a strong support network around you, and your friends are here to help you and support you to get through this, don't be afraid to ask for help."
"I am always arguing with my father. He gets stressed over work and health and talks to me in a tone of voice that seems very demanding and seems more like yelling. I get upset often at this. Am I too sensitive? He always says I am overreacting but never seems to understand that he is hurting my feelings. No matter how often I try to tell him this, he never listens.","Thanks for the question. Regardless of whether or not you are sensitive, it is okay to want better communication with those who are important to you. When we feel that we are being talked down to or being ridiculed, it is difficult to not take it personally. It sounds like you have taken the first and necessary step in resolving this by bringing up the issue to him. Is it possible that the delivery of your message is causing him to feel blamed or defensive? Try communicating with him during a time when you are not upset and when it is out of context. Begin your statements with ""I"" as opposed to ""you."" For example, you can tell him, ""I feel angry when you raise your voice at me"" instead of ""You always yell at me."" Also, avoid using black and white terms such as never and always. Additionally, offer sugggestions as to ways that he can better communicate with you. Maybe he just doesn't know how to. Lastly, when delivering a message, I like to use the sandwich method by starting off the discussion with something postive and ending it with something postive. For example, you may say something to the effect of:""Dad, I enjoy the discussions we share and really value your opinion. There are times that I feel angry when you talk to me aggressively. Perhaps you can try talking to me using a calmer tone when I bring up heated topics. Let's try and work on this together. I will try to be less sensitive and I am asking that you be more calm.""I hope you find this useful!","It sounds like you're feeling very validated by saying you've read this. I think you may be sensitive to the tone when speaking to your dad. His tone is often difficult to read through as it is the tone of voice from where he is speaking with the emotional weight of his frustration. Perhaps he is just being frustrated when he talks to you and not thinking about the way it's affecting others. It could also be something else. However, it sounds like maybe your dad is sensitive to the way you respond to his tone. It sounds like you're reacting by getting upset, and trying to talk it out would be helpful. But since he's not there for you, I wonder if you are getting angry at him. It could also be something else. I would hope that you are able to calm down yourself so you can respond to your dad in a calm way."
"I've only been married three months. Every week, we argue about something, and it seems to be getting worse.","One key factor to consider is, are you able to repair after your arguments? It seems from your question that repair is lacking after any disagreement or argument. When couples are able to repair after an argument, they have an opportunity to learn more about each other's needs moving forward. I'm also curious if you're having the same type of arguments over and over? If you're stuck in a particular pattern, and can start recognizing what happens between you when this pattern happens, then you can start to name it. Once you name it, then you can take a break to cool off and come back to each after your nervous system has had a chance to calm down (about 30 minutes). The key here though is to make sure you have a plan in place - when things are good between you - an agreement between you that when you both start to get escalated, you'll name it or have an agreed upon code word to signal you don't want to continue this cycle, and then agree to cool off and come back together at a later time. That way, when this is enacted during an argument, nobody feels abandoned during the cool off time. Rather, both partners know they will return at a time when they can truly hear each other and hear their needs.","You and your spouse have a lot in common and a lot of shared interests. It's difficult when those common interests are being used to justify your lack of effort or a lack of sensitivity. There are some basic tools you can use to help this relationship. A list of them is below.  Remember, it takes a team approach to relationships.  The first step is to work on what is happening in your relationships. As you work on your relationship, you'll find that you're able to have some control over the relationship, as well as increase your own happiness.  If the amount of conflict decreases, the relationship is likely to become stronger.  The way to do this is through having difficult conversations with your spouse about how you can work to improve the relationship.  Sometimes, spouses are more willing to work together than others.  In order to improve your relationship, you could try having a conversation with your spouse that would establish the rules of engagement.  You need to agree with your spouse on how you will handle conflict.  There are several types of conflict styles. One of the first steps to start with is the ""win-lose"" style. The ""win-lose"" style is when one partner wins and the other loses. When you use this style in your relationship, it will usually get you stuck in a cycle of arguing.  If you both win, you'll be stuck fighting over what should have been a disagreement.  This is often the source of more conflict than the initial argument.  The next thing you should do is to learn how your spouse ""wins"" and ""loses.""  Then you could give your spouse input into what they are doing with their conflict.  In order to do this, talk to your spouse and tell them that you want their input in to how you're fighting.  You could say things like ""When you argue, this is what you do: you say X then you say Y. When I fight I say X then I say Y. I think it's a problem when we do this, because what I hear is that you don't listen to what I am saying.  When I say X or Y I would love it if you would just listen to me. The other way around: when you are fighting, I want you to listen to me and tell me you're not mad"
"I started seeing this guy that I met at a mutual friend’s place. He recently broke up with his ex-girlfriend and started seeing me. Everything was great in the beginning, then I started having low self-esteem thoughts and thinking he was hanging with his ex-girlfriend again. It’s all I think about. I am still seeing him, but things have changed because I am at a loss for words. I get stuck in my own thoughts. I like and care for him a lot. He just makes me nervous and gives me the butterflies.","Sounds like you are struggling with your own negative thoughts.  As you stated, everything was great then you started having low self-esteem thoughts and thinking.  What is contributing to these negative thoughts?  His actions or your past experiences with unhealthy relationships would be my question..","First, I will ask you a few questions about what is making you feel this way. For example, on a scale of 1 to 10, on which number do you rate your self-esteem in general? Then, after that, it will help me help you find what is making you feel insecure."
"He's lied about his past/present situations. Since time has passed, he has changed, but I still have my doubts. I have no idea if I should stay or go, but I hate this feeling. I don't trust him all too much, but yet he hasn't done anything for me not to trust him recently.",Your doubts about your dating partner need to be addressed and solved so you can fully believe him again.Otherwise how would you actually know whether he's lying to you now or not?Start the conversation with him about wanting to trust him and asking for whatever details you feel will give you confidence he is telling you the truth.If he really wants to clear your doubts then he will be willing to invest in answering your extra questions or wanting to look through his phone or whatever areas you felt were violated by him in the past.,"It's easy to feel like you don't know what to do with feelings like this. If you really hate this feeling, then I feel like you have trust issues with who you are getting close to.  If you continue to have some doubts about whether to stay or go, trust your intuition, or find an extra little bit of courage to be honest. There is nothing wrong with being honest when it comes to what you really feel. I truly hope you have a more positive relationship with the person you're wondering about and more confidence in yourself as you navigate this situation."
"I got sick really bad and was throwing up for three days and nights. I thought I was going to die. Then about a week later, I started having this desire to be female. I never had this desire before. All I can think about is being a woman. I don't get pleasure from my penis anymore either. Women are attractive, but not like before. I can also find men attractive now. I'm too ashamed to tell anyone.","Hello, and thank you for reaching out to ask for help. Surely this is a very confusing time for you! If you have never had these
feelings and desires it could certainty shake everything you thought you knew
about yourself. 
My guess is that you becoming sick around the time that this
started is likely a coincidence, but I understand how you would make the
connection. 
I have a feeling that a few things may be going on here. It
is really hard to say since I don’t know you, how old you are, etc. But, I will
share you with you some thoughts. 
Some people, when they have undesirable thoughts that really
surprise them, have a really tough time getting rid of them. Our reaction to
the thought can be very strong and our tendency to try to block it out, stuff
it, avoid it, etc. is not always successful. In fact, it’s usually not. 
It’s like telling you not to think of pink elephants. I
would be willing to bet that you thought of a pink elephant just now. 
So, rather than fighting thoughts that you find confusing,
sometimes it is helpful to allow yourself to explore the thought with curiosity
and without judgement. Where is this thought coming from? What are my feelings
about it? Asking yourself these questions may help you come to a resolution
about what is going on. 
One possibility is that you have developed an anxiety about
your thoughts and now you are in the process of obsessing about them, but
another possibility is that you are legitimately exploring your sexuality and
gender. I get the feeling from your question that you do not want to believe
that it is second possibility. And that is okay. 
You can try some of my suggestions, but you can also see a
counselor who may be able to help you work through your confusion. I would
suggest someone who has experience working with sexuality issues. You can
usually find out what a counselor works with on their website. What is
important is that you find someone who is non-judgmental about what you are
experiencing. 
 
I wish you well.
Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC","The feelings you describe suggest you might be experiencing an increased awareness of the gender in you (sex) and the feelings you have about what you find attractive. This increase may be accompanied by anxiety, shame, or a desire to change the feelings in you (sex) and what you feel about yourself.  You are experiencing sexual interest in women more than previous experience, and having the desire to be female more than in past experience, this is your first experience with the topic. This increases your knowledge, increases shame and regret (as in your past negative feelings about yourself), and can lead to anxiety and shame (of which you may or may not be able to help yourself with). Since you already feel ashamed of what you think of yourself, taking some time and asking yourself if there are things that could cause those feelings in you are also appropriate.  I would recommend you talk to a therapist.  Therapy can help you see your thoughts and feelings about yourself in a more detached way."
"My stepdad and I always mess around. I've noticed that whenever he playfully hits me, it's always my butt that he hits. He always comments on my outfits and always scans me head to toe when I walk into a room. I'm a teenager female, and I want to know if this is normal.","It's hard to tell from the way you described it. Do you think he would be open to an honest discussion? It could be that his comments about your outfit are designed to make you feel good or to help them show how much he cares about you as his stepdaughter. As far as scanning you from head to toe, I can think of reasons that parents might do that. I also think that talking about it is probably very important so you really know what his intentions are. That way, it removes the guesswork and you have the opportunity to know what he is thinking and feeling and he can also know what your reactions are.","I am sorry to hear that your stepdad is hitting you, especially because of how he comments on your clothes. Your mom says that he always scans you, so I would suggest that he is trying to take advantage of you. If he does, I would suggest that you tell your mom what that is.  Your mom would be the best ally for you, because she would be the one who would have the most insight. If your mom says it is common for him to do that, then it is just more important that your mom tells your dad."
"My mother has Alzheimer's and she has become so nasty and mean to everyone and she always asks for unrealistic, silly or meaningless items. I get so frustrated and angry, but then I feel guilty because I know it probably isn’t her fault. How can I cope with feeling like this?","It is challenging to see one's parents age and to cope with the new demands.  Your mom means a lot to you, and that is why you get easily frustrated.  I'm guessing that it is not that she is making you do work or that her expectations are non-important to you because if that were the case, you would not feel any guilt.  Accepting the new stage will help you cope with the changes.  Take a deep breath every time you feel frustrated and think of the good times you shared with your mom before her getting Alzheimer's.  Remember that your mom as she was is no longer and that she has reverted to a more delicate phase.  Also, schedule time for yourself and do things that help you relax.  Caretaking of an elderly parent can take a toll on you, and it is essential to incorporate self-care.  Finally, look for an Alzheimer's support group in your area that will help you connect with other people going through the same thing.  You are a good daughter, and your mom is lucky to have you in her life.Sincerely, Mirella~Image and Likeness Counseling","Hello!I can hear and feel your anger and frustration in your writing.I hope that you would love or enjoy being this way with your mom. If I could give you that advice as a friend who is emotionally connected to you, I'd be very cautious about doing it.I know that you don't have to go to a therapist who knows me, but I still think that counseling could be helpful for all who have a relationship with someone who has very challenging memories or behavior.I am not sure about this suggestion, because it does feel like you have to take on someone else's emotions, and it's not your job to get even with someone else's problems."
"I am a female, and I am afraid of having sex. I am afraid of disappointing my partner by being inexperienced. I think he thinks I'm not a virgin. I am also scared that he will be disappointed with my naked body. I don't want my partner to think differently of me because I am afraid of having sex.","These fears are completely normal. Almost everyone has the same fears you do, to some degree, especially if they lack experience. Men also feel far more of these fears than you realize. That can help...to remember that we're all a little scared and looking for safety and approval.You mention a partner, but I'm not sure if you currently have one. Having a partner you can trust with your fears and who you feel safe with is so important. When you're really confident someone cares deeply for you, this can help the fears to go away or diminish. How well do you know your own body? Getting to know how you like to be touched and how different touches feel...getting acquainted with your body yourself first...this can help build sexual confidence. In general, our partners care less about our fat and wrinkles than they care about how we make them feel in bed. Being a generous lover who is confident enough to put fear aside...ironically this is what makes you ""good in bed"". But be patient with yourself. Your confidence will grow with experience, and that doesn't have to happen until you are ready. There's not rush. :)","It sounds like you're dealing with some anxiety. This is a common fear.  Do you want to talk to a therapist?   If the sex anxiety goes against your needs, like a need for you to love someone's body as it is.  It's good for you to know what drives you.  Would you like to talk to a therapist about the feeling to be a virgin.  Maybe there is another part to the anxiety here.   The anxiety about disappointing him may also be there.   So if you do know you are comfortable with this kind of feeling, you have a good idea of what is going on.   I think that some form of therapy may be helpful for you with this anxiety.   Would you like me to help you find a therapist.  If you want to talk about what is causing you anxiety, I'm happy to.  Just let me know.  And I'm always here to listen.  But also, if you feel like you'd rather talk to someone and be helped, I'd also suggest you talk to a therapist.  It seems like there are other possible reasons why you are so scared."
"My husband and I got into a huge dispute. He said he wanted a divorce, and I left. I still come home a lot and see my kids, and he has not filed yet even though he still said he is. What does that mean for our marriage?","In any relationship, including marriage, each partner will be better able to do their part, by understanding their own interests and wishes.Concentrate more on what you'd like from your marriage.  This will naturally raise the questions and criteria of what to talk with your husband about and what to ask of him.Think over whether you wish to divorce or not.Since he hasn't taken any action, then for the moment, you can assume he is not sure of what he wants.Once you feel a little more clear on your opinion about your marriage, including feeling uncertain if you'd like it to end or continue, then you will be able to tell your husband the suggestions you have for resolving the dispute matter and emotions.Try to re-direct your speculations about, ""what does he want"", ""I wonder what he's thinking"", back to answering these very reasonable questions, about yourself.This will strengthen your own purpose in clarifying where to start and guide a discussion with him.Good luck!","""It likely means he needs time to figure out what he wants or needs. It is possible he wants to go the divorce route and he may also need time to sort out his feelings towards you. It is also possible he has other reasons, such as you not meeting his needs to the degree he needs, or that he needs to take care of his own emotional or physical health. It could also mean that one of you has a deep-seated issue that he will need to resolve before making a decision. In any case, he is choosing to leave us, and this is painful, but it can also be an opportunity for each of you to re-evaluate what is important in our relationship and how we want our future to be. Do you know if you are both able to accept this outcome? The important thing is to understand what he's asking for (i.e. the other side). After he is in a place where he can see he's not willing to move forward, he should be able to come to you and state that he needs a divorce.  However, don't take the word of any man in the relationship as gospel, because they can tell you how to feel what matters to them and your partner would still be on the wrong side of the scale.  Do not accept a divorce without understanding what it entails."
"I've always thought that there wasn't much good out there for me. Now that things are actually going well, it kind of scares me. I spent most of my life feeling unwanted and figured I would be alone. I recently met a great woman who seems to really like me, and I don't know how to process this. It's bothering both of us.","You're in a lot of good company and it's great that you're in a positive relationship. Congratulations!I often hear people talk about loving yourself and self esteem. We often seem to blame ourselves for not ""loving ourselves"" enough or put ourselves down for having low self esteem. It seems to me that since we are essentially socially beings and in fact, need each other for our survival, we really know who we are through our many interactions with others and with our environment. In other words, you can't just snap your fingers and voila! now I love myself, where there was an empty space or self-doubt before. We grow that warm coal inside ourselves through the friction of contact with others who value and validate us.  Allow yourself to be patient with yourself as you experience this new relationship. You are learning a new model of who you are and how you fit into the world. What a marvelous gift for you! You may also have fears that the current joys may be temporary or unreliable. These fears of loss may get in your way, however understandable. If you are truly close to your companion, you can share with her that you are loving your relationship but sometimes fear it will go away and sometimes have trouble really trusting it. Such a conversation may bring you both closer. Hang in there. You're working on co-creating a new normal with a great woman.","Hi, the emotions you're experiencing, feeling lonely, fearing not being wanted or liked and wondering how to process that, have nothing to do with ""not being wanted"" or ""not being liked"". Most people want ""being wanted"" and ""being liked"". The difference between being wanted and liked is whether you feel they appreciate you enough to want you back and have the time and energy to do so. However, if you don't feel loved or accepted by the people around you, it is a signal to give to yourself that you are not enough. Often, this feeling of not being enough is caused by having low self-esteem (feel bad about yourself), lack of confidence, or feeling isolated. If you're feeling lonely, you could begin building that sense of connection with others by volunteering to help people out, or by saying hello to new people in your local area. Most people enjoy being good company! But if your feelings of insecurity linger, seeking some kind of support or guidance from an expert in the field of human development, or with more extensive experience in therapy, could provide a much clearer way of navigating this part of your life."
"Sometimes, I'm fine and can go out or meet people, but other days, my heart races and words physically cannot come out of my mouth. I've always thought it was normal and I was just nervous, but the other day, it took me almost 30 minutes of sitting in my car to find the courage to enter Target by myself.","It is possible that you could have or be developing an anxiety disorder. There isn't really enough information provided here to suggest a particular disorder, but it might be worth meeting with a counselor or therapist to do a formal assessment. Some of the questions they might ask could be what other kinds of physical symptoms you experience, how frequently these physical symptoms happen, what's going on for you when they tend to happen, and how frequently/intensely you find yourself worrying in general. Anxiety itself is a really natural thing - it's just when it starts interfering with your ability to ""do life"" the way you want that we start to consider potential disorders. It might be that for the most part, the anxiety you feel is normal and you simply have some triggers that intensify it more than usual. Working on your own or with the support of a counselor/therapist to both address those triggers at the root and also to develop ways of managing the actual anxiety symptoms. This two-fold approach can be really helpful for not letting anxiety keep you from engaging in life the way you'd like.","It sounds like you're really starting to identify the root of your anxiety. Sometimes, anxiety, whether it's social anxiety, generalized anxiety or something else entirely, can make things feel more difficult to deal with than they really are. So if your anxiety happens a lot, it could be a sign that there's something you have to work on. Not everyone struggles with anxiety.  There are good strategies and tools that you can use in order to manage it. Sometimes, the goal isn’t to eliminate all anxiety, but simply to learn how to handle it so that it doesn't become overwhelming. Would you like to talk about any of these aspects that are confusing you to feel anxious about and more specifically work to help you manage this way in the future?"
"Everyone around me is much smarter and flaunts it. Everyone around me is skinny, and here I am trying to throw up so I'm not fat. Everything I do is wrong, and I can't seem to do anything right! No one else at school seems to feel the way I do! Is this normal teenage girls feelings? I don't think these feelings are normal.","There are some struggles that are less ""obvious"" than others, an eating disorder being one of them. From just your personal experience alone you might realize how easy it may seem to keep such a secret from those around you. In the same way, there are many people who struggle secretly with this problem and not many people know or even notice. So you are definitely not alone. Low self-esteem or lack of confidence in some areas are issues that EVERY teen, in fact EVERY person, has experienced at some point. These feelings are ""normal."" It sounds, though, as if these feelings of insecurity and inadequacy have begun to consume your every day thoughts and behaviors bringing you to where you are today - comparing yourself to others, purging, and feeling extreme guilt. Sometimes it's best if we seek outside help, instead of trying to tackle problems on our own. Breaking habits that come along with an eating disorder really requires the help of a doctor, nutritionist, and a therapist who can help change your perspective from the inside out! Hope this helps!","It's understandable why you feel such feelings.Teenage girls experience hormonal changes that can lead to mood swings. However, it’s not normal. There may be underlying issues to consider that require discussion with a medical professional."
Now I have anger and trust issues. How can I treat this and fix myself?,"I will assume that for whatever reason, you either do not want to or are not able to seek counseling for this. However, I highly urge you to do so because long-term childhood abuse does have negative consequences for your life as an adult, as it seems you are already aware. There are confidential and free crisis hotlines that you can call that deal with sexual abuse. Some/most also offer free counseling services in local areas. That would be a good place to start looking, especially if cost of counseling is an issue.The important thing to know is that what happened was not your fault and that you deserve to live a happy life free of the past. Having anger and trust issues after something like this is a perfectly normal reaction to what happened to you. Angry? Yes! At your brother for what he did, at your parents for not protecting you. Having trouble trusting? Of course! The very people who were supposed to love and protect you hurt you instead. Two books that might help you are Codependent No More and Boundaries: Where You End and I Begin.","Good question. When anger starts and trusts is gone from us, we don't even know how to feel or feel what it is like. It's the fact that we are unable to feel any feeling. That brings us back to what we felt that we trusted. It's hard to understand what we were able to feel for a time and it's okay if you are at the stage of trying to reconnect with it as you re-learn that we feel. But if we're stuck in anger we don't know what is going on with us and what's going on with the others.  Trust is a powerful bond. In a relationship. It can be one of the most difficult and important things in our lives. So, if we're feeling angry we can start to be more confident and be sure of our feelings.  And that's it. You don't have to see what's going on with someone who is angry in order to understand yourself and feel connected to your inner voice.   Your therapist will help you see the root of the anger. And if all that feels too heavy for you to handle alone, I recommend finding a therapist.  A therapist is trained to help people come out of emotional blocks.  And that's what's so special about feeling grounded as we have become.  So, feeling more trusting and anger has nothing to do with either or, but more with knowing that you both may have the opportunity to be connected."
I have this weird fetish that I'm afraid to open up about it. What should I do?,"This is difficult to answer because you don’t tell us what the fetish is.  I do understand that this is something that is bothering you though. The first thing to ask yourself is if this is something that is illegal or not.  If this is illegal to engage in, then you need to seek counseling help immediately to control the urges.However, if your fetish is not something illegal and you just feel that it is something odd, a therapist could still help you deal with these feelings.  You may find that it is something very common and not something to be ashamed of.  You may find other people have the same interest as you.  Find a therapist that you can trust and tell them.  Don’t hold back with your therapist.  Trust me, they have heard and seen it all by now, and they can help you either stop the behavior that is causing you distress, or help you come to terms with accepting the behavior as part of who you are.  There is no need to suffer with this alone.","You're asking about sexual thoughts and desires. It's okay to be curious and have desires.  Sexual desire and desire are very common in adults. However, it is also okay to not be interested in what other people do. Sexual attraction should never be based on harm, degradation or violence. Be respectful of yourself and others as it may not be what you want or are interested in.  If you're feeling this way, you may need to see a doctor to be sure that you are not experiencing a medical condition.  There are many things about sexual interest that you should know. These things are often quite personal and have no one to blame. I hope the above guidance helps you."
"I want a secure relationship with someone that wants to be with me and who will actually put effort into it.
 I seem to gravitate toward unavailable men and those that want intimacy and no relationship. I let men dictate and control me because they accuse me of being controlling. I let men emotionally abuse me and I am at their beck and call.
 I am not comfortable being alone or doing anything by myself. I feel I need the security of someone being around just to survive. I know what I'm doing wrong and I do it anyway just hoping things will change. How do I stop this behavior and thought process?","You may be interested in reading my most recent post, Intimacy Begins With You. In it I offer 7 expert tips to help you get started on a path of self connection and discovery. This is important stuff to do in order to work through that stuff that's holding you back from the relationships you desire. You may find that it's especially helpful to do this work with the alliance of a skilled individual therapist.","I think it's possible that you're a person-pleaser, and you have a lot of qualities that makes you a good partner.  But perhaps in order to feel like you are truly loved and appreciated, you need an additional person to tell you that you are loved and appreciated.  In other words, you are most likely still attracted to men that seek to control you. It is possible that you are also willing to forgive the reasons that the men are difficult to take no for granted.  There are a lot of ways to improve your chances of being the only person you are attracted to. Start by deciding what your goals are for your relationships and who you want to be with.  It's also possible that in your current relationships the men's behavior and you've learned to make the most of the relationships you're in. You probably don't need to keep looking for someone to fill the space you're not filling. However, if you don't want to make the most of your current relationship, then you are likely to feel a lot of unease about this and will feel you're going to have to get out.  If you would like to be more confident in your own ability to choose your own path in your relationship, it is worth doing some work for this alone. However, before starting with new relationships, you must make sure you have established yourself in a good enough position to decide to continue with them.  By looking at the patterns of this issue, you can try to start there.  But I can't tell you whether or not you are going to change your behavior.  You will know if this is possible if you find yourself in a place where you feel safe and free to do so.   This is the most important part.   I would recommend seeking help with your relationships, but make sure you know that you're not always going to agree with the advice of couples' or therapy partners.   I hope this is helpful for you!"
"My friend’s husband is bipolar and refuses to take medication for it. He has taken the wheels off her vehicle before to prevent her from leaving. He has held her a prisoner in her home. He has choked her, hit her, etc. She has almost divorced him a couple of times but always makes up with him, thinking that he is going to change. She and I went to a wedding out of town in September of 2014, and ever since she has been back, he is convinced that she cheated on him while we were gone. Now he is saying that I have also cheated on my boyfriend and has come to my house and told my boyfriend this.","I’m glad that you  are seeking help and that you are supporting your friend. I’m sure this is all overwhelming and frustrating for you. The biggest thing you can do for your friend is to be supportive as you are already doing. Unfortunately there isn’t much you can do for her outside of that because it is up to her husband to change and up to your friend if she wants to leave. There are things you can do to support more: it might be helpful for her to have some information on a domestic violence non profit in her area because they can assist her in many areas if she wants to leave. They can also provide you with support while you go through this with her. The nonprofit can also safety plan with her and it might be helpful for you to do it with her if you want to. Another thing you can do is support her in decision to stay with her husband or not despite what she decides. Many victims decide to stay with thier abusive partner for many reasons. It is important to support her decisions, even if you don’t agree with them, because she may have very little decision making in her relationship. I would also encourage you to make sure you are taking care of yourself while you support her so you are not becoming too overwhelmed. Here is some info that might be helpful to you. https://abuseintervention.org/sandbox77/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/How-to-Help-a-Loved-One.pdf","Hi, it sounds like your friend is going through a really difficult time in her life, which may be more difficult for you to deal with than others. This is difficult to say to you, but it sounds like your friend may have been very hurt in the past. Maybe you and your friend have something in common?You may both have had a difficult experience in the past.You may both have been put into a difficult relationship and never really moved on.I know that you would love to give your friend as much of your support as you can give her.This sounds like a lot of hard work for you, and you should not take care of yourself if you have trouble dealing with the situation.And so you are asking for a friend to not do this?I don't think so!You are right to ask her to stop doing this.You did give her help and advice.You did your best, and there is nothing wrong with that.I suggest that we both put our relationship to the side and come back to work on your situation as a team.I hope that this is easy for you! Your friendship could still be strong after all this is over.If that's the case, you probably shouldn't ignore your friend, but you might want to work with her to try to solve the problem instead of being angry with her for doing this.I hope that you and your friend can move past this, and get back to your friendship.You do not have to handle this on your own."
"My ex-girlfriend says she's bored and wants to experience life single. I treated her really badly and caused meaningless fights when she didn't do anything, I feel remorseful, and I'm willing to do whatever it takes to get her back. She's unhappy. When I called her, she was crying and said she will text me when she's ready.","Were you happy with the ways she satisfied you?A relationship is happiest if each partner concentrates on the happiness of the other.Strange for someone who was treated badly to describe themselves as bored, rather than say they feel hurt.Is it possible you are being self-critical about your behaviors toward your ex girlfriend? Either she is unaware of her feelings or not being fully truthful with you about her feeling badly treated.Since she's putting up a barrier to communicating with you, better for you to respect this than contact her by phone again.Consider in a few weeks, so each of you has time to think over your happiness with the other person, to write her an email which states your interest to re-open the relationship.Who knows, you may even decide by the end of a few weeks, that you're fine without this particular relationship.Depending on her response to your email, you'll know whether and how much chance there is for the relationship to clear up the problems of the past and to continue.","Well... If she's not ready, then you need to know why. If she has feelings she has about it, why don't you talk to her? Because maybe she's busy, or maybe she wants your attention. You have to communicate what you feel you need to know, then she gets the opportunity to tell you what she needs. Not telling her right now can be harmful in the long term.  You don't have to know how she is to see it, it might be better if you're not. It does not mean that you're not taking care of her, or that you're not taking care of yourself! I know a man who gets jealous and angry when he calls a woman back and responds saying ""I am not interested"" because if he is upset he may go on about the reasons for this in detail and his feelings that he has been hurt. There are many things that can make a woman want to be single, but there aren't many reasons why she'll be single and happy.  It is not uncommon for women to wish for love to find them.  It may be a very good sign.  Just remember this is going to take time for you to work on yourself and you may not see immediate results.  This is no problem!"
"When I get frustrated or upset, it becomes extremely difficult to keep my voice down. I also instantly cry and tend to have anxiety attacks. What can I do to try and control it?","I'm going to reframe this and you can decide if this is helpful!What I'm reading based on what you gave is that you are actually doing your best to manage intense feelings of internal dysregulation.  Anger is something that is generally a protective emotion that quickly arises to keep us safe in some way, whether or not the situation is truly a threat.  The part of our brain that perceives this is not controllable to us, so we don't get to decide what emotion(s) we respond with.It does also sound like you are experiencing some significant anxiety, maybe even underlying the anger?  Without knowing the context, it's hard to say what would help on an individual level but working through those triggers and what is really influencing them deep down could be beneficial.  There's many different ways to do that in therapy if you so choose that as your path.If you do decide to see a therapist, most will tell you that the goal is not necessarily to control your anxiety or anger.  Sometimes there's a strong set of beliefs that, when activated, are catalysts to strong emotions that influence behavior.  Trying to control an emotion on its own is usually unsuccessful for people because it leaves out all the other powerful elements at play.  Emotions are information and the brain sends that information out because it believes we need it at that time.  Therapists can help unravel that with you in whatever way you need, whether that's with somatic work, work at the level of belief (or schemas), or otherwise---hitting it at these deeper layers can unpair and/or decrease emotional responses.  It all takes work and time, so don't get down on yourself if the process is complicated or slower than you expected or hoped for.What we know though is that the brain is very capable of change (even if it's painful).   Hope this gives you a helpful place to start from!","It sounds like the stress and anxiety can be very intense and difficult to get out of. If your goal is to be grounded, it might be best to learn about mindfulness techniques that have been proven to calm people down?  Have a nice glass of water and give yourself some time to try one, and see if you can find a balance in what you do or feel for the next 20 minutes. If this is not very helpful, perhaps it is difficult for you to be mindful for this long period of time. You might try meditation techniques that are very simple and easy for beginners, like body scans or simply focusing on your breath for a few minutes at a time and gently bring your attention back as you notice your mind wandering. Or you could try looking for ways to move and exercise too. If you could incorporate these into your daily routine, you might find that you find a way to get some helpful balance to what you're feeling.  And perhaps you could also work with a mindfulness class that could introduce you to a new perspective. You might also be interested in learning more about what type of anxiety, how severe it is, and how to tackle this in a structured manner? Are you able to talk to a professional about this, and would like to talk to one?"
"I have been dating my boyfriend for eight years. We met in college off away from home and things went from good to bad when I met his family who treats him like he is their man. They expect him to take them on dates like to the movies and out to eat when they come around, and he thinks it's okay.","Well, then you learned something new about your boyfriend!Are you fine with having a different opinion than him and staying together.Think over how major a problem this is to you and if it is reason enough to leave the relationship.There are always plenty of areas of disagreement between partners in a relationship.The key to being happy is to know which ones you can accept and which ones are beyond your tolerance with which to live.Also, an early step would be to directly tell your boyfriend your opinion.   He may be willing to change his ways to satisfy you.","Congratulations on the long-term relationship!  I am very glad you have been with him for so long and that you have been with each other for a long time.  That is a very important moment in life where some people have time to develop a very strong friendship.  That may be the situation that you had and continue to have with your boyfriend for long enough for a very deep, personal friendship to evolve into something bigger.  If you have a friend, it can be difficult to know whether you have a close bond, and whether you want to work on strengthening a friendship that extends beyond this...  I am sure you're finding out with time and not just finding out what's going on.  You have the power to decide what you want to work on whether or not you want to work on the relationship.  It is your choice.  I am sure he is a very good and loving person who wants to be happy and with you.  I hope this situation helps you to move past this conflict so that you two are happy together."
"For my whole life, I’ve been very unconfident, insecure, and self-questioning. I'm super quiet because I'm scared of what people will think of me. I avoid all social situations as it causes me great anxiety. It is how both of my parents have always been, and I feel like I'm doomed to that life also. It makes it super hard for me at work as the other employees try to use me and walk all over me because I’m too nice. It causes me depression and brings me down. I’m in my early twenties, and I really need to create a better life for myself. I've been like this for so long, so how do I change?","One of the greatest ways that we can promote ourselves s by learning how to assert ourselves.  Despite what most people think of when they hear the word assertive, assertive communication is one of the best ways to manage interpersonal conflict as well as maintain personal boundaries.  Once we become comfortable with acknowledging our boundaries, there is usually a follow-up whereby we realize that we have the right to those boundaries.  In effect, assertiveness communication becomes it's own self-motivating force in managing positive self-esteem. You may want to invest in a workbook that can help you to develop these skills on your own, or work directly with a therapist to develop them in a safe situation.   One of the Workbooks that I have found to be very helpful is, ""The Assertiveness Workbook: How to Express your Ideas and Stand Up for Yourself at Work and in Relationships"" by Randy J Paterson.","This sounds like such a long time of working on yourself, so what did you do with all that time in between? This sounds like you did a lot of introspection and did a lot of work with yourself. I can see that your parent's way of life has created a cycle of self doubt and self shame. It sounds like you have already created a new way of dealing with your shame. It is not a bad way of life to be good to yourself or feel secure. In your childhood, you likely heard lots of critical comments about yourself. I can imagine that you learned that you were not good enough, as those are things we often expect of ourselves.  If you believe you are inherently not good enough, there will always be one person that comes along and judges you (even unknowingly, in a moment).  In order to change this, you need to stop blaming your parents and other people.  They are not necessarily the cause of your feelings and will not stop the problem. You have to give yourself permission to judge people for negative comments and be nice to yourself and others, no matter what.  If that is more hard than you think, we can also find ways to make you feel like someone who is not bad enough, who is still there for you and who cares.  You are still alive and can get you to your goal.  It sounds as though you have been going through some tough times, and that this is where that will help you realize that you are capable of doing anything that you put your mind into.  The difficult part is to trust that you are capable of more than you imagine.  The first step is to know you. It is good to know that you are capable of doing it, this means knowing you, feeling good about you and being able to do what you want.  It's very common, by the way, to have bad body image and/or the feeling that you are not good enough so they are afraid of you! That is a big part of being insecure and self-doubting. You have a long way to go. It sounds like you have been in a tough situation with you and people around you and the emotional damage that your childhood caused has been enough to push you along here, and if you're feeling that way now, and there is no change coming from this, then I advise you to work on yourself so that you feel better about yourself and"
"My depression has been reoccurring for a long time. It all started when I was being bullied in high school. In ninth grade, my principal told me I needed to stay home for a couple days to protect myself while she spoke to my classmates. I needed professional help for my stress because I was having crying spells from the stress of going to school and confronting my classmates. After that, I was fine for a couple of years. I entered my first year of college in a really tough program with high demands of expected work. I believe my depression re-booted from there with the stress. I began to cut myself because a friend of mine at the time told me how she used to do the same and it used to feel good for her. Obviously, that wasn't the right choice. I regret ever doing that, seeing as even though I'm not self-harming anymore, I always look back at that time whenever I feel very stressed. I have a big problem with handling problems in life. Whenever a problem arises, I get stressed and I feel hopeless, as if it's not going to get better. I get way too stressed from my problems, which leads to overreacting a lot (especially when talking to others), which then leads to depression. I have a hard time coping with stress because I know that if I could handle it easily then I wouldn't be sad all the time, and I would say and do the right thing instead of overreacting to my loved ones.","I couldn't help but notice that you did not specify your age, so I am unable to set the total chronological order and length that you have suffered in this way, but I want to start by commending you on seeking out additional coping techniques on your own.  Unfortunately, it sounds like you were offered some that were more dangerous than helpful, but be proud that you were able to curb those before they caused too much harm. From what you have written, stress has always been a difficult thing for you to manage.  Often, when I am working with those who offer the same concern, there is a degree of people pleasing that comes with that stress.  When we are trying to make others happy, especially when we are unable to distinguish the proper ""rules for success"", it can make even the simplest of tasks overwhelming. Stress management is just that, management; of our own anxieties about the needs of others, about our skills and the ability to complete a task and having multiple requests at any given time. Each of these aspects requires a separate sets of ""tools"" to manage them accordingly. For example, assertiveness communication training could aid in communicating with your colleagues to manage their expectations of your deadlines and abilities, but it will not assist you with managing your own anxieties. Try to separate the different areas of the problem, in order to help yourself to find a solution and work on them in their own time. Perhaps keeping a journal will help you to better understand why you are so easily overwhelmed by stress and help you track some of your less-helpful responses to stress. For example, does a certain person's style of communication always make you feel undervalued and therefore push you to finish their requests first? Is there a certain time of the day where you start to fall off in productivity?  Is that the time fo the day where you also tend to pile up your requirements?Try to ask yourself some of these harder questions and see where they lead you.","Depression is a serious disorder that includes various symptoms like sadness, fatigue, and loss of interest in things you once enjoyed. You also are experiencing symptoms like that because they are not associated with a disorder and are just a normal part of life. There are many ways that depression symptoms are different, but in the end the things that you experience have to do with the mood of your brain.  This does not mean you need to be over a therapist. It means that your depression has a lot of issues that may need treatment with help in getting it on track.  Talk to your doctor about how to help you feel like you have some help. I hope you feel better soon."
"Or how to send him somewhere that can help him, something like The Baker Act.","More information would be needed for me to accurately answer this question, such as your age, whether you live with your dad or not, and what other family members live in the household. Something like this, alcoholism, is a whole family disease. In other words, family members often unknowingly contribute to the alcoholism and enable the alcoholic to continue the destructive behavior.First of all, you can’t make your dad do anything, and constantly nagging him or begging him to stop is just going to make him defensive and make this worse. Nobody can change another person. What you can do is change how you react to him and the things that you and other family members do for him. Research codependency. There’s a great book called Codependent No More. There are a lot of articles on the internet that you can read. In short, you have to stop enabling him. Like I said, you cannot control him, but you can control yourself. This means do not buy his alcohol. Do not make it easy for him to get. Don’t loan him the car keys or pay any household bills for him. Don’t call in sick to work for him or make excuses for him in any way. Do not bail him out of jail when he gets arrested. He needs to be responsible for himself. This may mean losing his job or losing his driver’s license. This may mean that he loses his family if he doesn’t stop. What you and your family can do is set boundaries about what you will put up with. It is his choice to drink, but it is your choice to put up with the behaviors of his drinking. A lot of people go into rehab because their spouse said if they don’t then they are getting a divorce.If you are an adult and you don’t live with your dad, then the best thing you can do for him is STOP doing things for him. If you are a child who lives at home with him, then this could be a case for child protective services. In my state this is called DHS. A report is made to this organization for child abuse or neglect. Substance abuse in the home qualifies. Of course, alcohol is legal and when consumed in moderation, there is no problems. The problem will be the result of his alcohol consumption. Does he drive with children in the car while intoxicated? Is he left to care for minors while in an intoxicated state? Are there any domestic violence issues due to his drinking? This could be a reason for the authorities to step in. You can look for a local meeting for family members of alcoholics. They are similar to the AA meetings that an alcoholic should go to, but are for the family members. They can help you.","The question's tone is not one that would invite therapy. The question's tone is one that invites sympathy, while needing to go to a hospital for treatment is a very different situation. The question suggests that the person wants someone to help, and is hoping to help himself too. It also suggests they can't do this for themselves (because they're feeling suicidal.)"
I believe it is wrong for men to look at inappropriate content. The father of my child has agreed to respect my beliefs. His co-worker sent him an inappropriate video. He got mad because he does not think he should tell his friend to not send him things like that.,"It sounds like you are wanting to protect your child from degrading images and that is one of the important parts of the job of a parent. Although it is challenging to supply an answer without knowing the full situation, it might be helpful to have a more broad discussion about what you both think about the influences and images that your child is exposed to and what you think your role is in protecting your child. This situation is one about beliefs and values and could well be an example you can use for exploring your parenting roles in protecting your child.",I wish you all the best in your future.
"I'm a teenager. I get random spurts of anger, like complete, pure rage. I figured it was hormones, but others notice it too. I get self-destructive. I used to cut but stopped. Now when I get mad, I bite my arms and fingers, pull my hair, scratch my face, or punch my thighs. Basically, I do things I can hide instead of breaking anything in my room and having to explain it to my mom. I don't live in a bad household. I have a great family, a great relationship with my boyfriend, and a good job. I have no idea what this is and I don't know how to control it. It's over any little thing. Tonight, it was because I couldn't get my earrings out. This happens maybe two to three times on a good week, and it's always over stupid, petty things.","Hi. I'm glad you wrote. In general, when a small thing bothers us (and this happens to all of us), it's because the small thing triggers an emotion in us that we have felt ""too much"" or ""too intensely"" in the past, and we don't know how to manage that emotion effectively...we just want to avoid it as quickly as possible. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy with a qualified therapist can help you to understand what is being triggered in you and learn how to manage emotions productively. You say that your behaviours are self destructive, and I agree. It sounds like you have developed a habit of channelling your distress towards self-harm, and this is a separate and potentially more serious problem. This is a choice you make that points to shame being an issue for you. Again, a good therapist can help you learn what's behind your shame and self-harm. Your feelings are normal, and you can learn more healthy ways to deal with them with qualified help.","It sounds like you're telling me a lot about how you feel about being angry. Your question sounds like you are angry towards your parents, your boyfriend, yourself. Your son asks you if you feel anger is normal or crazy and tells you that you don’t even have any control. That's the most important question to get yourself answered here. It sounds like it might be some depression that is coming to you and affecting your parenting skills. A good way for you to know if that's true is to do a couple of things. Ask your girlfriend if she thinks that you have some kind of impulse control issue and if you are using any of your words to have a fight in the middle of your relationship. If you are, then you should talk to your parents about how they can help. When you're upset, the only way that your mother and father are going to be able to help is by you asking them what they think you're doing wrong. Asking your son questions that get him thinking about how he handles his emotions will help you see if he is overreacting."
I get very nervous and anxious/scared before sex.,"I first wonder what your anxiety or fear connects to. I don't know whether it is about sex itself or about ideas of worthiness or feeling desirable.There is also a difference between having self-doubt about the actual physicality of having sex (performance-related) or having doubts about whether you want to have sex with a particular person.Having sex can lead to feelings of great vulnerability. If your partner is someone you trust, consider discussing what it is that comes up for you around the issue of sex. This is the certain things that your partner would be willing to do that and the ease your discomfort, like staying with you for some time before and after sexual interactions.Another idea to consider is spending time with your partner and using nonsexual touch for each other (perhaps first you to him and then him to you) and communicating very clearly about what you like and do not like. Some people like to be spoken to during physical touch and other people do not. All of this can be part of your discussions. When you feel comfortable with that, you could move into sexual touch in this manner and actually look at what you do and do not like. You may also consider discussing things that are totally off-limits for you all the time and things for which you would like warning or awareness before they happen. There are really a number of different ways to work on becoming more comfortable if you trust your partner and if your concern is about sex itself.If this feels pretty structured, it is initially. Generally, the idea is to learn more about each other and yourselves and then the process becomes much more natural.If the concern relates more to self-esteem related sex, consider asking your partner to list several things that he or she likes about you. Even if you don't necessarily see yourself in the same light, consider that this is how your partner sees you, so these are some of the things that make you attractive to them (perhaps both in sexual ways and in a wider discussion of the relationship).If this is difficult for you to sort out on your own, consider seeing a therapist with experience working with couples or relationships.","It's common for couples to have anxiety and worry about sexual intimacy during different times of the cycle. Some may notice that they both share an anxious tendency to hold back during a sexual encounter. It can also be caused by a number of factors, such as hormonal imbalances, relationship stress, or certain medical conditions. If the anxious feelings before sex were present prior to getting married or starting a new sexual relationship, that is something to discuss with your partner, and perhaps even seek professional guidance such as couples therapy."
"My husband told me last year he never loved me and should have never married me. He's been talking about divorce, but he hasn't filed. Now he has a girlfriend and he abandoned me and his kids. He has no financial help, and he has been out of the home for four months. He became very angry and mean. He says it's all my fault, and that we're not compatible.",It's hard to say that it is a midlife crisis stage..  could be... but so much more seems to be going on or have been going on to say with confidence that it is not much more.,"This sounds like a really complicated situation with some really painful history. His feelings seem to have started with a very strong, and perhaps unrealistic, belief that he never loved you and therefore the marriage was doomed. The fact that he's been married for 4 months doesn't necessarily mean he has to leave, but it does mean you have a little time to work through some of his difficult feelings and work towards making a decision about what's best for you and your children.    Your next step should be to talk to him one-on-one, with a very open mind and no judgment. It sounds like you are both quite upset, and are understandably frustrated with this lack of communication.  If he will work with you and listen to your feelings, he will be an important part of your life.  You have the power to choose how your life is now."
I easily recognize this but have no control over it and need suggestions for managing my anger.,"I suggest that you work on emotional awareness. Emotional awareness basically means knowing what you are feeling and why.Emotional awareness also means that you can identify the link between the way you are feeling and your actions. In other words knowing that your feelings dictate what you do.Often feelings of hurt or insecurity can come out as anger if we cannot properly identify and express the feelings.Being emotionally aware also means that you are able to express your feelings to others. Being unable to do so leads to feelings of frustration and being misunderstood.Many people for many different reasons are not in touch with their emotions. For example, men traditionally have been brought up taught to not express sadness or weakness. Therefore, many men learned to turn feelings of sadness, insecurities, or fears into anger and express these feelings as anger. Being taught not to feel a certain emotion does not make that emotion disappear. Instead it makes us learn how to express it in other, incorrect, ways. If a man never learns to say “I am sad” or “that really hurt my feelings” and instead lashes out in anger, then the response they get from those around them will be to the anger and not a response to the underlying true feeling, which will leave the man feeling alone and misunderstood.You can control yourself and not explode. Walk away, remove yourself from the situation, do whatever you have to do to not lash out. Instead of reacting the way you normally would, go somewhere by yourself and think about what just happened and try to understand why such a “simple” thing upset you. What is the real feeling driving these outbursts? Maybe you can begin to recognize an underlying pattern. It might help to keep an anger journal. Write down everything that gets you upset. That might help you see a pattern and pinpoint what may be setting you off. Talking with a therapist about this would be beneficial in helping pinpoint the underlying cause of the outbursts you are experience.",I wonder if you could try meditating on what triggers your anger?
"Two years ago, I was separated from the military into my contract for medical issues. It has emotionally destroyed me. I now basically hate myself. It's embarrassing to be separated from the one place who takes anyone. My family has been in the armed forces, and it has always been my dream. I can't do this alone anymore, and now my family is even worried.","It sounds like being separated from the armed forces is a major loss for you. It takes some time to work through the emotions related to this and it often takes longer if you are trying to work through it without a lot of support.Is there a task that you were doing during your military service that can in some way transfer into civilian life? I don't know what else your life involves, whether you have close friends or a romantic partner, a career, activities that you like to do, and many other things. You may be able to use some of the things that you still have today as a way to start moving forward in a different direction.Your military service will always be a part of you. Thank you for your service.","A few things are likely causing some emotions that would make you feel anxious. It may be an example of PTSD, or maybe you have some feelings of helplessness, shame or embarrassment at this time in your life and this separation. It's difficult to say which is more accurate without further evaluation. For you, and maybe your family, your future is being heavily influenced by the past and it can be scary. At the same time, having some expectations and knowing when you're losing that is a good way to manage it. So if you want to feel better and start making progress then do these things: first you will need to talk to the people I am mentioning and ask for your family to support you. As well as them talk with your father/husband or his partner about your situation. The military is there to help them. That's what it's for. You may have to go through this because of a past trauma, for example. As for your feelings about the pain that you are experiencing, that's normal. If you had any experience with a traumatic event, that may lead to this pain. I know you didn't have a traumatic event for you but you should ask yourself if anything has happened to you that makes you feel less like a person, and would like your parents/father to like you as well? It is okay for your parents to be worried about your future. I know you may not agree with them, but I think they are only trying to help you. That is a common sense thing to do. But if you feel more connected to yourself and want to heal from your experiences then the last step is to work out the feelings that are making you feel less like a person, and work with your therapist to heal from them. Maybe we'll find something else that works for you and try some new things while you work at that and we'll get there!"
All we do is argue. We never agree on anything.,"Simply, Yes!Just because you argue, does not mean your marriage is not worth it. Couples disagree. They are different people from different worlds with different likes and dislikes. Trying to mesh these different worlds is tough, but does not mean you don’t need to not be married.There are reasons why couples don’t get along. Finding out why you cannot compromise and working towards similar goals can help. Talking about what you really want out of the marriage and relationship may show y’all how much your relationship goals are similar. Then you can build upon that.Learning communication skills, listening skills and ways to improve your ability to express self without anger can help.",I'd rather have an argument with a complete stranger. I'd rather have a complete stranger who knows the way to hell.
"I started dating a guy I met online. He told me that he registered sex offender but he didn't do anything. He took a plea to always register as sex offender and he did two years. That was more than two decades ago. Nothing on his record since. I always believe the past should be left in past. But my roommates, their family and my son are unforgiving. Should I forgive this man that I'm falling in love with or should I dump him? If I stay with him I will never see my family and granddaughter again.","Thank you for your question. Trust is a huge thing in relationships and when that is broken, or perceived as being broken, it takes a long time to repair. From what you shared, it sounds like your boyfriend took steps to correct the situation and has shown to be trustworthy since. Unfortunately, no matter how much we apologize for something we did or for something others perceive we did, there will always be those with hardened hearts and will not forgive. If you feel confident in your relationship, then trust your inner wisdom. We cannot control others but only ourselves. Respect your families wishes to remain in unforgiveness while at the same time, ask them to respect your wish to believe in him and be in this relationship. Good luck to you.","There are many reasons why someone might not have a clear picture of what happened during the time he registered sex offenders. He was trying to leave the past behind. It's not his fault, and it doesn't excuse the fact that he did what he did. He was only 14 years old, and it's a long time ago. Even though the sex offender is gone, the impact of the event still exists. He is probably still living in the shadows, and if you are thinking of getting involved with him it is too dangerous."
"I have three children: a biological daughter, a stepdaughter, and a stepson. I found out my stepdaughter overdosed today. My daughter blames me. I told her to stay out of it. I'm scared of all three kids now. They all blame me for their choices they made. All three have drug addictions. I had a stroke in 2013 so I need to depend on people from now on.","Blaming others is one of our greatest coping mechanisms.  It is not just for addiction, and often we blame the ones closest to us.  You can not stop them from blaming you, you can stop yourself for taking on the burden.  We are all in charge of the choices we make.  No one makes us do something other than our self.  We choose how we internalize and react to situations.  I would find a good therapist who understands family dynamics and addiction to help you cope with your current environment and help you move forward.","I hope you feel better by the end of the day. I do not like this situation. Your stepdaughter has overdosed, and she has been working on getting clean for years. She is not allowed to be around you and the rest of the kids to avoid being judged for this. Your daughter seems to believe there must be a reason that she is trying to get rid of the drug. Try to explain to her that sometimes people are so full of anger and hurt that they make terrible decisions. Help her understand that someone is sad or angry from their situation. She is not your fault. The family has made a big mistake by hurting her and I wonder why all the other children don't take steps to help her. Maybe one of the other children can help her get help and get back on her feet. What have you thought about talking with your daughter? If you can start to talk with her about how you see things and listen to her point of view, that may change how you feel about her. Your decision of whether or not to blame your daughter and involve the police is up to you. But I hope you feel less stuck by having this hard decision you're in now."
"My daughter didn't see her biological father for the last three years. She doesn’t want to see him because she remember really bad things from him such as domestic violence and child abuse. The visitation is with supervision, but she refuses to see him. Is it better to take my daughter to the therapist and try to see him after the therapy?","Hi Dillon,I'm from Canada, so I don't know the laws in your state. It depends on that a good deal, perhaps. In my opinion, a child should never be forced into a situation where they feel unsafe, even if it is ""supervised"". If the child is old enough to make a strong statement about not wanting to see a parent, then this should be honoured. Unfortunately, the laws don't always uphold a parent's right to do what is best for their child. I recommend you see a lawyer, who will advise you about how to proceed without putting yourself at risk of breaching custody agreements.If you feel your daughter can benefit from therapy, that is a separate question. Or is she already in therapy? A family therapist will typically meet with you alone first, in order to determine if therapy is a wise move for your child. It isn't always appropriate.","Hi there, in your question, you mentioned that she only remember really bad things from him.  I do not know how old she is, it is very hard to guess the length of time. So I would say that what she is saying is true.  A big part of childhood, especially the early years is about establishing a very strong, possibly rigid sense of self and boundaries.  Someone like him would be able to teach her some very bad habits.  So she is making a wise and healthy choice when she decides not to see him.  It's very good that you, and your daughter are considering this choice.  Sometimes that is all that is needed.  But it is good to also say that a child may be reluctant to let down her guard, which is something that is very common.  What she is doing is an act of self-protection.  By not seeing him, she is protecting herself from being hurt again.   Her therapist may be able to help you both with things like setting boundaries, but it will take some time and effort.  As for seeing him after therapy, that depends on him and what he is able to offer.  Good luck! I hope you are able to reach out to him!"
"I've been hospitalized twice. Once was last month for psychiatric help. I'm on medicine, but I'm struggling with fighting the negative thoughts, irrational fears, and loneliness. The people around me aren't helping much.","If you are someone who usually has a job, pays or contributes to household bills, and generally manages your own daily life, then here are some suggestions.Start with small changes in your life so that you will feel successful in developing little areas of personal happiness.Since the people whom you currently are in your life ""aren't helping much"", consider branching out your life so that you are with those with whom you do feel help you.Follow your natural interests.  If you like reading, look online for a local book club.   If you like watching birds, look up a bird watching group.Social isolation increases the intensity of negative feelings.Also, the way healthcare is set up in the US, psychiatrists spend 15 minutes asking a person questions and then giving them a pill script.    There is almost no human interest in the person.If you'd like feeling better as a person, then find people.   Relying only on our mental health system will keep you feeling low and unsteady.If your life is a little more sheltered and you are in a group home setting or your basic needs are taken care of by someone or some organization, then similar advice is still valid.Find and participate in whatever human settings which appeal to you and are available on a somewhat regular basis.","I would be glad to listen. If you're going to talk about the medication you're taking, I am interested to know why you are having so much trouble resisting it.  Sometimes this is due to a chemical reaction. If you don't know the chemical, talk to a pharmacist.&#x20; I would be glad to tell you what is going on with the medications I've used for this as well. Sometimes a medication will have side effects, even if they are not the intended ones. As well as an underlying medical condition that is not well-treated, which can lead to the medications I use to treat such conditions. Sometimes, if the medications don't work, you may need a doctor to switch you off of the medications. So if you're having trouble working with your medications, perhaps you can speak to the doctor.&#x20; Are you having problems with your doctor?  If you are, have them talk to me. I am able to hear your concerns and offer suggestions on how to take this conversation further."
I need to speak to someone about sexual addiction and binge eating immediately.,"There is an organization dedicated to helping individuals find affordable counseling.  It is called Open Path Collective.  There is a one time membership fee of $49 and it lasts for your lifetime.  You then have access to local counselors/therapists who will see you for an extremely reduced rate, anywhere from $30 - $60.   https://openpathcollective.org/","I think you're in the right place to talk to someone about this. Sexual addiction is more than bingeing. As is with other disordered eating behaviours, it may be because of other trauma that has been involved in you life or that may influence what your body feels like. You are going to find that if it is a traumatic memory, then it is going to manifest differently. These feelings could affect how you feel about your body or even in what ways you find yourself wanting to eat. As people who know you better, you may also know your own personality traits. Are you a shy person or very expressive? Do you find it easier to connect with people in real-time, or do you prefer to be online and online for a long time? It is more important to know what you enjoy from your own body to better connect with it, which is a process of learning more about your own body's needs and desires.It also would be helpful to talk about what is happening in the past, that may have influenced you in a way that makes you feel you have a relationship to the foods that you eat. If you can identify the issues, that will likely make a huge difference.If you are nervous to talk about that, don't worry! You're welcome."
"I've been in a relationship for almost a year, and I absolutely trust my boyfriend. He treats me nice, checks on me, and tells me sweet things. However, when it comes to making life decisions, I feel he is very immature. I try to talk things out so we can compromise or make sound decisions together, but he lacks any ideas and prefers to just go with anything to avoid fighting. As far as dates, if I don't say anything, plan it, or have money to chip in, we will not go. I feel like I put in a lot of work supporting and sometimes spoiling, and all I get is a loyal man who will not cheat and say sweet things on occasion.","Well, then your decision is whether you want to stay in this type of relationship or not.One point to keep in mind is this.Just because he's not telling you his opinions doesn't mean he doesn't have any opinions.In the long run t is always easier to talk with someone about their differences from our point of view than to be someone who doesn't tell you what is in their mind.Short term it seems easy to have someone agreeable.Long term someone who doesn't tell you their thoughts and who disagrees with you, may potentially go about their true wishes in hidden ways.","That sounds like a very lonely and possibly painful type of relationship, in many ways.  Trust is important, but what is happening may not be the kind of trust you hoped for.  The issue is whether you trust him with decisions. You're asking him to do a lot of work, and his response seems to be that you don't share decisions that will affect him and are unwilling to have a partner who is involved in decision making.  Most would hope for a partner to participate in key decisions about their life and share a certain level of involvement in any important decision-making process.   When a person doesn't want to participate or share decisions, whether it's regarding major life choices such as marriage or children or matters of finances, or choices about spending time with friends, it can create frustration, disappointment, and anger in the relationship.  In addition, if there are decisions that affect him but you don't share them, he may believe his voice and desires were ignored.   Sometimes, this leads to a feeling of isolation, and even though you trust your boyfriend, you may feel like your desires and experiences are being ignored, which causes resentment or a sense of powerlessness.  When it comes to a relationship, you do not need to control your partner's decisions.  However, it is worth noting that this isn't usually a problem in healthy relationships.  Most good relationships allow the two individuals to develop their own independence and make their own decisions without the constant threat of that partner being alone with their decision.   The important thing to consider in this is, and whether you feel the other person cares for you enough to support your decisions.   In this instance, you may need to talk to your boyfriend about the kinds of decisions you would like to share with him.   You don't want him to make all the decisions and you don't want him to feel like he's the only one who truly matters.   You can say something like, ""I do wish I had a partner who shared with me the kind of key decisions about our lives.  I know your feelings are different than mine, but I would like to be able to discuss our decisions and feel as though I am a shared partner.  I think it's important that our decisions are"
"I was raped by multiple men, and now I can't stand the sight of myself. I wear lingerie to get my self excited enough to have sex with my wife.","I am very sorry to hear about your rapes.  Traumatic events, such as rape, can have some lasting effects.  Issues with sex drive are one of these effects.  Therapy can help to decrease the impact that traumatic events have upon our lives as we process through some of our experiences.   EMDR can be a particularly effective modality of treatment to address this issues.  I would also encourage you to have an honest conversation with your wife about this concern.  Sometimes it is helpful to have that conversation with a therapist so that the therapist can help educate  your wife in regards to effects of trauma.  This may help her understand that your feelings are more about the trauma and less about her as a person.  Best of luck to you!","My guess is that you've already learned enough of what can lead to someone being at risk of the experience that you're able to have sex with someone else. I'm curious about your partner's views on sex. There is the possibility that they have similar views about their own sexual desires, their own beliefs about healthy sex and relationships.  If there are similar views about consent, they may be able to support you in your desire to have sex with another person.  It may be a good idea for both of you to explore with your partner the questions on consent, pleasure, and how the sex came to be, so you can both come to peace with what happened to you.  You deserve your own body, your own desires, and your own choices about your body.  And I hope that you and your wife have an open, loving, and non-judgmental sex life."
"I'm in love with my own gender, and my parents are against that. I don't know how to tell them because I'm afraid they'll not want me anymore.","Hello, and thank you for your question. This is one of those times when you wish you could assure someone that everything will go perfectly, but unfortunately I can't do that. There is no way of knowing how parents might respond until you tell them. The truth is that people have come out to their parents in many different ways. Some have told their parents directly, some drop hints, some have had others tell their parents, etc. The only ""right"" way to come out is the one that you choose. The one that feels right to you. That is the best way. Some people decide not to come out, and some wait for a very long time. Both of these things are okay. Coming out is deeply personal, and there can be real consequences to someone's emotional health and safety if they tell the wrong person. That is why it should only be done when you are ready. When you feel that you have the emotional and personal support that you need to take the risk. Sometimes people can feel pressured to come out, but I encourage you to do it in your own time. The truth is, there is a spectrum of how people's parents react to this kind of news. On one end, you may have the parents who shut a person out and are abusive, and on the opposite side you may have parents that are totally okay with it and throw you a ""Coming Out"" party. Most parents are going to fall somewhere in the middle. It is important to remember that their feelings may change over time. Many parents struggle at first, but they love their kids and get better with it over time. If you decide to tell them, consider taking someone along to support you. Plan ahead on what you want to say. It can be an emotional time, so do what you need to do to take care of yourself. If you need to, leave. You don't have to stay anywhere where someone is being cruel to you. I wish you well, and good luck.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC","I'm sorry to hear that you have to face that reality. In the same way that I would not want to discuss this topic with my parent's because I think they are not healthy enough to handle such a topic, I would also not want to discuss this with the opposite side. This is because you'd have to deal with their reactions to it and try to figure out why they're not accepting of you for who you are. This topic is serious and can be damaging to your relationships with your parents and potentially to your mental health. You may want to seek a therapist about this if you are unsure about it or if you would like help figuring out what you need to do next.   The other important thing to note is that people who are not open to a situation and can't accept it will be difficult to work with. Sometimes the healthiest thing that you can do is to accept that your parents can't change and to accept yourself and that you will find your path, and this may mean moving out of their lives."
"I have been diagnosed with ADHD and experienced manic depression episodes. I have problems with anger management. Apparently, I also have an ODD, bipolar and split personality. How can I be truly happy?","The ADHD and manic depressive episodes are terms other people told you that you have.You don't have to accept these words to describe who you are.A lot of mental health in our country is about telling people what's wrong with them and giving pills for these so called conditions, instead of helping a person know more about themselves in order to make good decisions.You can be happy because nothing from the outside, such as the names people have used to tell you who you are, can interfere with your own wish to be happy.Others can slow you down because of the self-doubt and hurt feelings.  No one can take happiness from you, only they can make it harder to find and hold onto.Anger management only works temporarily because it is a surface approach.Think of the reason you are angry.  This will be better to know so you will be able to address it.Then you will not have anger to manage.","The symptoms I would give you all make it look like you have a very complex set of mental health disorders, but I'd rather know more information so that you are able to work with me properly. If you say I'm likely to diagnose you with ADHD, bipolar and ODD, or other things, I'd hope that I could help you find a way to deal with all the symptoms you're facing with different treatments such as: medications, and behavioral therapy.I would also suggest that you find a good therapist, so you can work with them and really learn about your issues, you don't have to do all this yourself. If I have a sense of what you're dealing with, I'd hope to be able to help you on your journey."
"I have a really bad temper. I get mad very easily then stay like that the whole day. I don't mean to be that way, but I can't help it.","A lot of times the anger someone expresses is from feeling a deep level hurt within themselves.   A surface situation, like, a store told you they'd have delivery of a certain item by Tuesday, and when that particular Tuesday comes, the store doesn't have what they told you they would, and you are furious.The fury may have more with many times before in your life, having been deeply let down by someone who mattered to your life at the time, who similarly promised something and failed to deliver whatever it.If at the time of feeling let down by someone important in your life, the relationship didn't allow for honest expression of all your emotions, you'd have learned to hold in what you realized would not be tolerated if you expressed it clearly.Without practice of being heard when feeling hurt by someone, eventually the person, possibly you, learned to contain and contain your emotions.It is possible that the anger you feel at a variety of situations lately, are muting hurt feelings that you've understood from relating to meaningful people in your personal history, to not talk about.As a way to find out if you feel other emotions in addition to anger, take some time to reflect on what triggered your anger and whether its possible that hurt emotions which nobody whom you know wants to hear,  are really the underlying source of your upset.I hope you will enjoy some new discoveries about yourself and your emotions!","I understand that you will be holding yourself accountable for bad tempers and staying calm.  There are many techniques and tools that have been proven to help people with anger management.  There is one technique that you can try, one called the STOP technique.  This technique stands for:  Stop, Think, Observe, Plan.  Once you stop your anger, you can then think about what you are actually angry about, what your reaction is and whether you can act on it.  This can give you the confidence that you can control your anger and the ability to work through your anger.  In addition, many people also find that they can focus on the most pressing issues first and do the rest when they are calm.  You can also do exercises to promote emotional regulation.  These exercises can include deep breathing, meditation, and even gentle exercises that involve the movement of your body.  If you have trouble with your anger, talk to a doctor.

I'm constantly in a bad mood and I have no energy. Is that depression?,"Depression has many different signs and symptoms and looks different for every person.  Often times people think depression is more about feeling ""sad,"" but depression can, in fact, express itself through irritability (or bad mood as you say) and lack of energy.  According to the DSM-V (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), depression includes the following symptoms:-Depressed mood-Irritable mood-Decreased interest or pleasure in activities you usually participate in or enjoy-Significant weight change or change in appetite-Change in sleep (insomnia or hypersomnia)-Psychomotor aggitation or retardation-Fatigue or loss in energy -Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt-Diminished ability to concentrate or indecisiveness-Thoughts of suicide or plan The great news is that there are many ways to improve depressive symptoms.  If you are up for it, perhaps the best place to start is by seeing a physician or a therapist who can help determine how severe the depression is and can suggest methods of addressing the depression that fit your lifestyle, values, and capabilities.  Good luck!","Depression can be hard to pinpoint and is usually a combination of negative thinking, low energy and negative feelings about life. This sounds similar to symptoms associated with depression. If you are wondering whether depression is a possibility and whether you are in the mood to seek help, here are some possible first steps:
1. Check in with yourself. Do you feel a significant number of sadness, hopelessness, or guilt? Also, do you feel empty?  These are some questions you might ask yourself.  If the answer is yes to all of the above, you may be experiencing depression.  If you are a man, it might be more difficult to discuss depression, so if you feel like this has been in your life for a while and it is a bit difficult to find a way to say it out loud, then I would have you see a doctor.  Mental health conditions affect everyone.  If there is something that is making you feel and think sad or sad, it will be much more helpful to talk to a mental health professional who may be able to help you find an appropriate way to express your feelings and see whether depression is the cause.  If you are able to express your feelings to others in a healthy and constructive way, then talk to a therapist or counselor about this.  If you're unable to communicate well, it may be helpful to seek the guidance of a support group.  Or, even better, some people may feel that the best thing they can do is a consultation with a mental health specialist.  Even if it is a temporary consultation, the therapist can help you determine your best course of action and help you determine where to go.  Some good resources include the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) at 1-800-662-HELP (4357) or [https://www.samhsa.gov/](https://www.samhsa.gov/).  Mental health professionals can also help you find support groups and local mental health resources.  Your insurance company may have resources in the area, so take a look at your current plan.  Your insurance plan may also cover therapy. If you have any questions about the amount your insurance plan covers, you can call your insurance provider.  You can also use online"
"I feel like every time I do something someone asks me to, I never fully meet what they want. I feel that when I finish it, they always think that they should have picked someone else to do it. I feel like they just want nothing to do with me.","It sounds like you have the perception that people are frequently disappointed in you, wish you were different or someone else, and ultimately reject you. One question I would have for you is what is your evidence that people feel this way? Is there anything in people's words or behaviors that gives you this impression? If your not sure, it may be useful for you to try to notice what people say and do in response to you, even though you perceive these attitudes within them. Additionally, working with a competent therapist may be a great way to get an answer to your question as well as developing ways to move forward with that answer and gain a sense of self-esteem and security in your relationships.One possibility that comes to mind, of which there may be more, is that as we grow up, we often develop relational templates, or sets of expectations about how people are and will relate to us, which influence our experiences and behavior in relationships. Sometimes the templates that we develop to stay connected growing up are not particularly adaptive for adult life and can hamper our self-esteem and capacity for comfortable intimacy as an adult. You ask a great question here, and one that can be very hard to see through, given the difficulty of feeling that people think of you in this way, and I hope that you will stay curious about this and consider working with a therapist who is trained to help you discover the answer.","If you like this, you have a good foundation for working out your own beliefs.  For most people, the most valuable thing people can do is be honest with their partners. This isn't about who is ""right"" or ""wrong,"" but about being honest with your partner about what you can and can't handle. If I was you, I'd say,""I don't know what you want from me, but I know what I don't want."" What are your boundaries for yourself? What are your limits for friends? You have no right to change this person's mindset about you. They can't, and you won't. They could be making the mistake that you're already dealing with, but you don't have to work to fix it. You're just telling them what works for you. If they don't follow through, what do you do? That is up to you. If they are unwilling to listen to your reasons, you should work with them to see if there is any other way to have a better life.  It is up to you to decide if you want that, but if you don't it is up to you to figure out how to manage your life.   This is the first step in trying to understand where the other person is coming from and see if you're truly missing the point.  If you can convince them to see your point of view, then maybe you don't need to try to change them. It's up to you to make the most of your time with them.  If you must, change the terms.  Not your relationship, but what you're doing."
